Sharing
=======

This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!

You can find my blog at http://sachachua.com .
