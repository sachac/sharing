This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-5">
<p>
I've gotten the hang of basic <code>multiple-cursors-mode</code> and I'm making
gradual progress towards internalizing <code>smart-parens</code> by the simple
approach of focusing on one tiny habit at a time. For example, I spent
a week reminding myself to use <code>mc/mark-all-like-this-dwim</code> or
<code>mc/mark-lines</code> instead of using keyboard macros. Picking one small
change and paying close attention to it seems to work.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by the <a href="http://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2014/emacs">Emacs Advent Calendar</a>, I wanted to start a 52-week
series on micro-habits for more effective Emacs use. Little things
make a lot of difference, especially when frequently repeated over a
long period of time. It reminded me of this quote I came across on
<a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=3529">Irreal</a>:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emacs?src=hash">#Emacs</a>: using transpose-chars is a litmus test. If you care enough to save keystrokes to internalize C-t, then you must be a power user.</p>&mdash; Fredrik Appelberg (@appelberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/appelberg/status/538282100911529984">November 28, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
I brain-dumped an outline of four sets (basic Emacs, Org, programming,
meta-habits) of thirteen small tips each. Looking at my list, I
realized there were many ideas there that I hadn't quite gotten the
hang of myself. I figured that this might be more of a project for
2016; in the meantime, I could learn by doing.
</p>

<p>
The first micro-habit I wanted to dig into was that of <b>automating
text:</b> abbreviations, templates, and other ways to expand or transform
text. I'd used Yasnippet before. I sometimes accidentally expanded
keywords instead of indenting lines if my cursor happened to be at the
wrong spot. But I hadn't yet drilled the instinct of automation or the
familiarity with templates into my fingers.
</p>

<p>
This blog post isn't the guide to automating text. I'll write that
later, when I've figured more things out. In the meantime, I'll share
what I've been learning and thinking so far, and maybe you can help me
make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
Emacs has a separate manual for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/autotype.html">autotyping</a>, which I had never read
before. The short manual covers abbrev, skeleton, auto-insert,
copyright messages, timestamps, and Tempo. Did you know that
<code>define-skeleton</code> lets you create a template that accepts multiple
interregions if you call your skeleton function with a negative
argument? It took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure out how
to mark interregions and use them. They have to be contiguous. It
might be easier to think of marking the beginning of the region,
marking some points in the middle, and then calling the command when
your point is at the end - which is probably how most people would
interpret the diagrams, but I was trying to figure out how to mark
discontinuous regions, and that totally didn't work. And then I forgot
that using <code>helm-M-x</code> means you need to specify numeric arguments
<i>after</i> typing <code>M-x</code> instead of before. (I wrote about that very point
in one of my blog posts, but it slipped my bind.) Once I got past
that, I was delighted to find that it worked as advertised. I still
haven't imagined a situation where I would use it, but it seems like a
good sort of thing to know.
</p>

<p>
What <i>are</i> the practical situations where text automation can help
people work more effectively? I looked around to see how other people
were using it. <a href="http://cupfullofcode.com/blog/2013/02/26/snippet-expansion-with-yasnippet/index.html">Coding</a>, of course - especially if you use Emacs Lisp to

</p>

<p>
I came up with several categories for text automation to help me more
easily recognize opportunities to work better:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16020717139/">2015.01.05 Seeing opportunities for abbreviations and text automation &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Abbreviations</b> are about typing long words with fewer keystrokes.
For example, you might shorten "description" to <code>desc</code>.
</li>
<li><b>Phrases</b> are like word abbrevations, but longer. You might want to
be able to expand <code>btw</code> to "by the way."
</li>
<li><b>Code</b> benefits from expansion in multiple ways:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Automatically inserting characters that are harder to reach on a keyboard, like <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>
</li>
<li>Being consistent about coding style, like the way many people like adding a comment after the closing brace of an <code>if</code>
</li>
<li>Transforming text that shows up in multiple places, such as variable names that need getters and setters
</li>
<li>Filling in the blanks: parameters, comments, etc.
</li>
<li>Reducing the cognitive load of switching between languages by
establishingq a common vocabulary. For example, I sometimes need to
look up the syntax of <code>for</code> or the proper way to display a
debugging statement when I switch to a language I haven't used in
a while
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Templates</b> are also useful for consistency in writing, planning, and other areas
</li>
<li><b>Text transformation</b> can save time and minimize error.
</li>

</p>

<p>
Translating the examples I'd seen to my personal interests, I could probably find plenty of opportunities to automate text while coding, debugging, writing, planning, or publishing.
To dig deeper, I looked at each of the categories in detail.
</p>

</p>

<p>
When I was curious about typing faster, I read forum posts from people
who had increased their speed by developing their own form of digital
shorthand. The trick works on paper, too. When I need to write quickly
or in limited space, I use abbreviations like <code>bc</code> for "because" and
<code>w/o</code> for "without." Why not on the computer as well?
</p>

<p>
I often take advantage of dynamic abbreviations when I know I've
recently typed the word I want. To trigger those, I just have to type
the beginning of the word and then use <code>dabbrev-expand</code>. I haven't set
up my own static abbreviations, though. Main obstacles:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want to write shorter words instead of longer ones
</li>
<li>In the beginning, it's faster to type the word instead of thinking of the abbreviation and expanding it
</li>
<li>If I have to undo or backspace, that makes me slower
</li>
<li>If I burn this into my muscle memory, I might be more frustrated on
other computers or in other apps (then again, I already customize Emacs extensively, so I guess I'm okay with the tradeoff)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Anyway, here's a short list I'm trying out with <code>define-global-abbrev</code> and <code>hippie-expand</code>:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<td class="left">probably</td>

<tr>
<td class="left">st</td>
<td class="left">sometimes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Hmm. Let's say that it takes me two keystrokes to trigger the expansion, whether it's the <code>xx</code> keychord I've just set up or the <code>M-/</code> I've replaced with <code>hippie-expand</code>. (Hmm, maybe a double-space keychord is a good candidate for expansion too.) Is the retraining worth a ~50% possible reduction in keystrokes? Probably not.
</p>

<p>
How about text with punctuation, so I can minimize reaching for symbols?
</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Maybe it's better to look at the words I frequently misspell, or that
I tend to slow down then typing. I'll keep an eye out for those.

<p>
Phrases are an easier sell. Still, I'm trying not to settle into the
rut of set phrases. I should cut those mercilessly or avoid writing
them from the beginning.

This is, fortunately, well-trodden ground. The yasnippet package comes
with a large collection of snippets for many programming languages.
You can start by familiarizing yourself with the pre-defined snippets
for the modes that you use. For example, in my installation, they're
under <code>~/.emacs.d/elpa/yasnippet-20141117.327/snippets</code>. You can use
the filename (or keywords defined with <code>key</code>, if specified) as the
abbreviation, and you can expand them with <code>yas-expand</code> (which should
be bound to <code>TAB</code> if you have <code>yas-global-mode</code> on).
</p>

<p>
I mostly work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and Emacs Lisp, so this is the cheat sheet I've made for myself:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16036967089/">2015.01.07 Code insertion &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
For HTML, I need to remember that the tags are generally expandable, and that there are a few Lorem Ipsum abbreviations triggered by <code>lorem.1</code> through <code>.5</code>. CSS has a <code>v</code> abbreviation that sets up a bunch of rules with vendor prefixes. For Javascript, I'll probably start with <code>f</code> to define a function and <code>log</code> to output something to <code>console.log</code>. Rails has a bunch of iterators like <code>eai</code> that look interesting. As for Emacs Lisp, the pre-defined templates generally add parentheses around common functions so you don't have to type them, and there are a few shortcuts like <code>bs</code> for <code>buffer-string</code> and <code>cc</code> for <code>condition-case</code>. I think I'll modify the default snippets to make better use of Yasnippet's field support, though, so that I don't have to delete and replace text.

In addition to using text expansion for code, you can use it for
planning and writing other text. I saw <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/emacs-chat-karl-voit-2/">Karl Voit</a> use it to great
effect in my Emacs Chat with him (around the 44:00 mark), and I've
been gradually refining some templates of my own.

<p>
For example, here's the template I've been using for sketched books.
Note: If you use Yasnippet for Org Mode properties, you may want to
set <code>yas-indent-line</code> to <code>fixed</code> or the fields will get confused.

<li><a id="unnumbered-10"></a>Text transformation<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-10">
<p>
One of the advantages of tweaking text expansion inside Emacs instead
of using a general-purpose text expansion program is that you can mix
in some Emacs Lisp to transform the text along the way. I'm still
thinking about how to make the most of this, as you can see from this
half-filled note-card:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16035718090/">2015.01.07 Text transformation as part of expansion &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
For example, this snippet makes it easier to share source code on my
blog while also linking to a Gist copy of the code, in case I revise
it or people want to comment on the code snippet itself. It doesn't
use any of the built-in text expansion capabilities, but I think of it
as a text expander and transformer because it replaces work I used to
do manually. You'll need the <code>gist</code> package for this one.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/e4e6efdb737fb6526ff2">Gist: Sacha</a>

                    (mark-inactive (gist-buffer)))))
    (kill-new
     (format <span class="org-string">"\n[[%s][Gist: %s]]\n#+begin_src %s\n%s\n#+end_src\n"</span>
             (oref (oref gist <span class="org-builtin">:data</span>) <span class="org-builtin">:html-url</span>) filename
             (replace-regexp-in-string <span class="org-string">"-mode$"</span> <span class="org-string">""</span> mode)
             contents))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Both Yasnippet and Skeleton allow you to use Lisp expressions in your
template. If you don't have all the data yet, you might consider
writing another Lisp function that you can call later when you do. For
example, in the sketched books code above, I have an Emacs Lisp link
that composes a tweet with a link, puts it in the clipboard, and then
opens up a web browser. (I do this instead of posting directly because
I also want to attach an image to that tweet, and I haven't figured
out how to modify any of the Emacs Twitter clients to do that.)
</p>

<p>
So that's what I've learned so far about automating text in Emacs.
It'll take me more than a week to get the hang of the abbreviations
I've just set up, and I'll probably need to add even more before
adding and using abbreviations become true habits. But hey, maybe this
will help you pay closer attention to repetitive text and editing
actions in Emacs so that you can automate them too, and we can swap
notes on useful abbreviations. Hope this helps!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-21">
<p>
The Lifehacker article "<a href="http://lifehacker.com/try-a-writing-meditation-if-sitting-still-isn-t-working-1673320289">Try a Writing Meditation If Sitting Still
Isn't Working For You</a>" reminded me of how I've never quite resonated
with the popular advice to clear your mind, meditate, and be mindful.
When people ask me if I meditate, the word makes me think of doing
yoga or sitting <i>zazen</i> or taking deep breaths &#x2013; none of which I do.
Maybe I'll come around to those ways eventually, but in the meantime,
let me share a few of the ways that work for me just in case they
might help you too. =)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16107254809/">2015-01-16 Thinking about why I don't meditate &#x2013; index card #reason #meditation</a>
</p>

<p>
I generally keep my life low-stress. Frugality gives me a buffer from
most of life's financial stressors. Low expectations and personal
responsibility make happiness easier. Stoicism helps me focus on what
I can control. 
</p>

<p>
I do like relaxing and being more appreciative. Everyday activities
like doing the dishes, cuddling cats, spending time with W-, and
following my curiosity give me that sense of abundance and fortune.
They also help me slow down my thoughts and bump into interesting
ideas. This reminds me of the relaxing side of meditation.
</p>

<p>
As for becoming aware of and addressing my self-talk or my thoughts,
writing and drawing do a great job of bringing those thoughts out
there so that I can acknowledge them or do something with them. I
think this is like the self-awareness side of meditation.
</p>

<p>
Still, sometimes something perturbs my calm more than I'd like. When
I'm miffed at something, that's really more about me than about
something else. It's a good opportunity to take a look at my thoughts
to see where I was lax or mistaken. This is like the clarifying side
of meditation.
</p>

<p>
So I guess I do meditate, but I don't do it in the
stock-photography-meditation sort of way. Here are some other tools I
use to shift my mental state:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16389045585/">2015-01-27 Resetting my mental state &#x2013; index card #emotions</a>
</p>

<p>
Activities that move my body or my mind make it easy for me to move my
thoughts, too. For example, walking gets me breathing fresh air and
looking around. Cooking immerses me in tastes and lets me enjoy doing
something tangibly productive. Reading takes me inside someone else's
experiences. Helping someone shifts my focus from myself to someone
else.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16186390139/">2015-01-25 Walking in High Park &#x2013; index card #relax</a>
</p>

<p>
(In particular, walking to a nearby park will almost certainly result
in seeing lots of really happy dogs. There's something about seeing a
dog with a big grin and an even bigger stick.)
</p>

<p>
What is it that I'm really doing when I choose these activities? I
think I'm quieting my brain enough so that I can think with less
distraction. Then I can pay attention to the thoughts that I find odd or that I'd like to address, to see if I can resolve them.
</p>

<p>
In addition to responding to life as it comes, I sometimes think ahead
about the way I'd like to respond to life. This is because my life has
so far been pretty awesome. I don't want to take it for granted, and I
also don't want to be blindsided by challenges. From time to time, I
think about more difficult situations that I could find myself in so
that I can try out different responses. This is the contemplative side
of meditation, I think.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16402680005/">2015-01-29 Being okay with unfair &#x2013; index card #stoicism</a>
</p>

<p>
So that's how I "meditate," I guess. No relaxing music, no super-deep
thoughts. Mostly just everyday activities and the occasional bit of 
reflection. Seems to be working for me so far. =)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-31">
<p>
When is it worth improving a skill you're already good at, and when
should you focus on other things?
</p>

<p>
I started thinking about this after a conversation about what it means
to master the Emacs text editor. Someone wondered if the additional
effort was really worth it. As I explored the question, I noticed that
skills respond differently to the investment of time, and I wondered
what the difference was.
</p>

<p>
For example, going from hunt-and-peck typing to touch-typing is a big
difference. Instead of having to <i>think</i> about typing, you can focus
on what you want to communicate or do. But after a certain point,
getting faster at typing doesn't give you as much of a boost in
productivity. If I type a little over 100 words per minute, retraining
bad habits and figuring out other optimizations so that I can reach a
rate of 150 words per minute isn't going to make a big difference if
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/05/quantified-awesome-blogging-wpm-and-the-speed-of-reflection/">the bottleneck is my brain</a>. (Just in case I'm wrong about this, I'd be
happy to hear from people who type that fast about whether it was
worth it!)
</p>

<p>
Some skills seem shallow. There's only so much you can gain from them
before they taper off. Other skills are deeper. Let's take writing,
for instance. You can get to the point of being able to competently
handwrite or type. You can fluently express yourself. But when it
comes to learning how to ask questions and organize thoughts I'm not
sure there's a finish line at which you can say you've mastered
writing. There's always more to learn. And the more you learn, the
more you can do.
</p>

<p>
I think this is part of the appeal of Emacs for me. Even after more
than a decade of exploring it and writing about it, I don't feel I'm
at the point of diminishing returns. In fact, even the small habits
that I've been focusing on building lately yield a lot of value.
</p>

<p>
No one can objectively say that a skill is shallow or deep. It depends
on your goals. For example, I think of cooking as a deep skill. The
more you develop your skills, the wider your possibilities are, and
the more enjoyable it becomes. But if you look at it from the
perspective of simply keeping yourself fueled so that you can
concentrate on other things, then it makes sense to find a few simple
recipes that satisfy you, or outsource it entirely by eating out.
</p>

<p>
It's good to take a step back and ask yourself: What kind of value
will you get from investing an hour into this? What about the value
you would get from investing an hour in other things?
</p>

<p>
Build on your strengths where building on those strengths can make a
difference. It can make a lot of sense to reach a professional level
in something or inch towards becoming world-class. It could be the
advantage that gets you a job, compensates for your weakness, opens up
opportunities, or connects you to people. On the other hand, you might
be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlearning">overlearning</a> something and wasting your time, or developing skills
to a level that you don't actually need.
</p>

<p>
When you hit that area of diminishing returns &#x2013; or even that <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2008/05/getting-through-the-plateau-of-mediocrity-picking-up-the-idioms/">plateau
of mediocrity</a> &#x2013; you can think about your strategies for moving
forward. Consider:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What kind of return are you getting on your time? (understanding the value)
</li>
<li>Is there a more effective way to learn? (decreasing your input)
</li>
<li>Can you get more value out of your time from this skill or other skills? (increasing your output)
</li>
<li>If you learn something else first,
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>will that make more of a difference in your life?
</li>
<li>will that help you when you come back to this skill?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These questions are helping me decide that for me, learning more about
colours is worthwhile, but drawing more realistic figures might not be
at the moment; learning more about basic Emacs habits is better than
diving into esoteric packages; and exploring questions, doing
research, and trying things out is likely to be more useful than
expanding my vocabulary. I'll still flip through the dictionary every
now and then, but I can focus on developing other skills.
</p>

<p>
How about you? What are you focusing on?

I have a friend who's focusing on learning how to ask better
questions. Actually, he realized his goal is probably to ask <i>more</i>
questions in the first place, since even simple questions ("Where did
you come from?") can lead to interesting stories.
</p>

<p>
It got me curious about getting better at learning from people. I
think this will help me learn about the stuff that I can't find in
books because:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New things often aren't in books
</li>
<li>There's a lot of tacit knowledge that's difficult to capture
</li>
<li>Sometimes I don't understand something well enough to research it
</li>
<li>Talking to people can help me come across things I didn't know to ask about
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15714563274/">2015-01-20 Asking better questions &#x2013; index card #asking</a>
</p>

<p>
I think getting better at asking questions and learning from people involves figuring out:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what to ask about (spotting opportunities or following curiosities)
</li>
<li>who to ask
</li>
<li>how to build rapport
</li>
<li>how to pick the right time/place/sequence
</li>
<li>how to frame the question (level of detail, phrasing, etc.)
</li>
<li>how to follow up
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So that gives me specific things to focus on in terms of learning from others and trying things out myself.
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about two aspects of learning from
people: working with mentors/coaches/trainers, and having casual
conversations with other people.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Mentors/coaches/trainers</b>
</p>

<p>
I've been lucky to have many mentors (both formal and informal) who
helped me learn how to navigate organizations, find opportunities,
build skills, and so on. But I haven't been as deliberate about
learning as I could have been. I periodically consider finding a coach
for my writing or coding, but haven't taken the leap.
</p>

<p>
I've heard from people who weren't sure if therapy was working out for
them; they couldn't evaluate their progress. I think I'm hesitant for
similar reasons. I'm uncertain about choosing candidates, asking
useful questions, evaluating the results, and balancing the value and
the opportunity cost.
</p>

<p>
This is precisely the sort of situation for which an opportunity fund
is useful, because it pushes me to Just Try Things Out. I'm slowly
warming up to that idea, hence all the blog posts thinking out loud.
</p>

<p>
Here are some areas I'm considering:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>How can I think in larger chunks?</i>

</p>

<p>
For example, an editing experiment might help me develop a better
mental model of an editor, forcing me to search for more specific
vocubulary (down with "stuff"!), testing to see if something I've
written makes sense, and checking for gaps.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16186736397/">2015-01-24 How can I learn from observation feedback &#x2013; index card #learning #people</a>
</p>

<p>
In addition to directly asking for specific help, I might learn a lot
from general observation. A friend suggested Atul Gawande's <i>Better</i>
for its approach to learning: a surgeon inviting other surgeons to
observe him and give feedback, even though this technique was mostly
used by people with less experience. It makes sense to do that even
when you're more experienced, and it's probably even more useful
because people can swap tips or explain things they unconsciously do.
</p>

<p>
<b>Other people</b>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15752626033/">2015-01-24 Mixed feelings about learning from people &#x2013; index card #learning #people</a>
</p>

<p>
I noticed that I have a strong bias towards online conversations
instead of offline ones. Sure, online conversations might be
lower-bandwidth or not as nuanced. But blog posts and comments expand
the conversations to include other people, and it's easier to follow
up on threads of ideas. I think this preference is among the reasons
why, compared to several years ago, I now spend much less time going
to parties or meetups. Instead, I focus on writing and connecting online.
</p>

<p>
But I get plenty of writing time already, so maybe I should mix more
offline conversations into my life. This would follow the principle
that <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/10/hell-yeah-approaches/">I shouldn't always do what's fun and easy</a>. It makes sense to
develop skills and routines in other areas as well. For example, I can
imagine getting better at cultivating acquaintances through shared
activities like cooking at Hacklab and hosting board game afternoons.
I can test and refine several quick stories for small talk, which
frees me up to focus on learning more about the other person through
questions. It's like the way foreign language learners can boost their
feeling of fluency by anticipating common questions ("Where are you
from?" "What do you do?") and practising answers to those.
</p>

<p>
I think that getting better at asking questions and learning from
people starts mostly from getting to know people as individuals. What
makes them different? What's interesting about their lives? There's
always something to find. The next step after that is to gradually
build the acquaintance or the friendship through things like lunches
or get-togethers. It makes sense to open my world so that I can come
across good people. I enjoy their company, I grow in helping out, and
I learn from the conversations with them and the mental models of
them.
</p>

<p>
<b>More thoughts</b>
</p>

<p>
Thinking about this, I realized that I'm not bad at learning from
people. I'm pretty good at learning from books, blogs, and online
conversations, which is why I rely on those so much. But there are
some aspects of learning from people that I can improve, and I can
play around with those without cutting too much into the time I spend
learning in other ways.

<p>
This push towards originality reminds me of how I've been drifting away from technical workshops, business conferences, and self-help books. When people teach other people in large, quick group settings or in traditionally-published books, it makes to go for a broad base. The more people you can help, the more affordable help is. Introductory material is easy to plan for, because you assume people are starting from scratch. Maybe they have no experience, or maybe they're tired of their old systems and are willing to start anew. If the market is sufficiently large, you might be able to plan for a slightly different profile: say, a Node JS tutorial for Ruby developers, or an Emacs tutorial for people shifting from SublimeText. For the most part, though, it's difficult to advantage of the skills students might be able to transfer from related fields. That's okay. The introductory stage is simply that. You just want to build competence.
When you get to the intermediate or advanced stages, though, instruction is harder, and learning is harder as well. No one hands you a curriculum to follow. You have your own goals and preferences, and you need to adapt or stitch together what you learn from other people. You need to come up with your own questions.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-34">
<p>
I know you're supposed to live in the present, but I get a lot of
value from thinking about futures and what I can learn from the
possibilities. Imagining different futures helps me see what I can do,
choose to do some things instead of others, and keep track of how I'm
doing along the way.
</p>

<p>
In the problem-solving model that Tim Hurson shares in <i>Think Better</i>
(2008), you come up with potential Target Futures and prioritize a few
based on three factors:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Influence:</b> Is it something you have influence over?
</li>
<li><b>Importance:</b> Is it important enough to you that you'll put in the work to get there?
</li>
<li><b>Imagination:</b> Can you solve it with an off-the-shelf solution, or do you have to come up with something new?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A good future pulls you toward it. You want it, and so you act.
</p>

<p>
I periodically think about what the target futures for my interests
look and feel like. Last year, I wrote about how <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/03/good-enough-good-awesome-thinking-want-get/">I don't need to get
to "awesome" in everything</a>. Sometimes it still helps to think about
what that "awesome" might look like, though. I realized that I don't
have to use the same definition of "awesome" that other people use.
Figuring out what "awesome" means to me can help me identify the
differences between my current state and my future state, and that
shows me what I can do or what I can learn to get there. I want to
pick differences that are mostly under my control, that are important
enough to call me to action, and that may even create something new in
the world.

</p>

<p>
I figured out a little more about what tickles my programming brain.
I'm not the kind of person who builds massively popular projects with
elegant architecture. Someday I might do a good job at <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/figuring-path-awesomeness/">building
bridges for other people so that they can do even better</a>. What makes
me really happy right now, though, is writing small, idiosyncratic
pieces of code that are tailored to my particular needs (or that make
things a little better for people I feel good about). On the surface,
this doesn't have widespread impact. but I guess it also creates a
future-pull &#x2013; showing other people that this sort of play and
customization is possible. So, if I follow that vein, amazingness
looks like:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seeing clear, simple ways to address challenges or take advantage of opportunities
</li>
<li>Pulling the pieces together (APIs, etc.)
</li>
<li>Making reasonable interfaces
</li>
<li>Writing decent code
</li>
<li>Being proficient with tools
</li>
<li>Getting good at that delivery and feedback cycle, whether it's for other people or for myself
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm getting a lot more practice in working with the APIs for services
I frequently use. I've scripted quite a few small tools that interact
with Flickr, and I'm looking forward to more experiments with Org Mode
and Evernote. I'm also working on learning more about the tools I can
use: debuggers, frameworks, even coding conventions.

</p>

<p>
What about working out loud? What would that look like if I could do it really, really well?
</p>

<p>
I'd keep detailed notes - probably in Org Mode, since that lets me mix
everything together: snippets, links, research, TODOs, etc. My notes
would help me get back on track after interruptions or delays.
Whenever I finish a small chunk, I publish a post, since that's easier
to work with than waiting until I've finished everything. I'll know if it's working if I:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>don't get as frustrated with dead ends, because I can just backtrack up the trail
</li>
<li>can look up my reasons for things I've forgotten
</li>
<li>can help other people find out about things they can do, take
advantage of example code, or probe my understanding
</li>
<li>get the occasional suggestion from people on how to improve what I
do
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm focusing on getting more of my thinking out the door. One of the
things I'm currently figuring out is how to balance logical order and
chronological order when writing up what I've learned. On one hand, I
want to save people time by pointing them straight to stuff that
worked. On the other hand, it can be useful to see the thinking
process. I'm experimenting with using signposts (like the "later in this post" part of <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27830&shareadraft=baba27830_54b92ac511e86">one of my write-ups</a>). I'm also experimenting with harvesting tips and putting them into occasional other-directed posts.

</p>

<p>
I don't need to get to Pulitzer-prize-winning awesomeness. I want to
get better at figuring things out and sharing them. I think this
involves being able to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>wrestle with vagueness and beat it into specificity
</li>
<li>share practical tips
</li>
<li>extract ideas from research, other people's thoughts, and my own
experiences so that I can help people save time
</li>
<li>and back up everything reliably!
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If I can get better at <b>seeing</b> things, that's a really useful bonus.
Since the easiest way of doing that seems to be sheer accumulation of
experience, I'm focusing instead on other things that I can get better
at first. Research is one of those skills I want to build up again, as
there can be lot of value in a good literature review.

I'm also working on building up and linking to different chunks so
that people can read at the level of detail they want. By setting
constraints on chunk size and getting better at managing an archive of
linkable things, I hope to be able to organize thoughts more flexibly.

<p>
I imagine that as I get a sense of questions (other people's and my
own) and good sequences to answer those questions in, I'll get better
at putting together guides that lead people through those sequences.
This helps because sometimes it takes a lot of knowledge to figure out
what the next good question is or how to formulate it. For me, that's
what packaging is about: making sense of things, and then sharing that
in a way that helps other people make sense of things too.

I'm still far from getting really good at this, but as I build up

The book <i><a href="http://earlyretirementextreme.com/ere-book">Early Retirement Extreme</a></i> (Jacob Fisker - CreateSpace: 2010)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Intellectual goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be able to quickly prioritize the relevance of information and be able to quickly research and find relevant information in many different areas. Learn independently and have an interest in doing so.
</li>
<li>Have enough generalized knowledge to be able to understand the information and put it into the context of a mental framework, a model or procedure, and use it to ask further questions.
</li>
<li>Recognize which problems the model applies to, take the solution to one problem, generalize it, and apply it to another problem.
</li>
<li>Be able to critically analyze the model, refine it, and combine different models to achieve an objective. Practice critical thinking in all aspects of life to reach a degree of rational certainty. Be open to new ideas but do not accept anything uncritically.
</li>
<li>Synthesize interdisciplinary information and laterally connect similarities which are not immediately apparent, discovering new models and procedures.
</li>
<li>Evaluate different methods, models, and procedures while effectively ranking them for utility, and picking the best one while recognizing the pertinence of other methods. Pursue relevant and correct knowledge persistently and consistently. Master the fundamentals.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
This! I want to get better at all of these things. Based on feedback
from my clients, I do pretty well already, prioritizing requests and
potential resources, quickly cobbling together a tool from different
pieces, and connecting the dots.
</p>

<p>
But what would even better look like, and how do I inch closer to
that?
</p>

<p>
The more you know&#x2013;the broader and deeper relevant knowledge you
have&#x2013;the easier it is to learn, since you have more resources for
understanding and remembering new information. So the more I read and
the more I try, the easier it is to learn.

<p>
One of the ideas I'm picking up from <i>How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</i>
(Arnold Bennett, 1910) is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When you leave your house, concentrate your mind on a subject (no
matter what, to begin with). &#x2026; By the regular practice of
concentration (as to which there is no secret—save the secret of
perseverance) you can tyrannize over your mind (which is not the
highest part of you) every hour of the day, and in no matter what
place. The exercise is a very convenient one. If you got into your
morning train with a pair of dumb-bells for your muscles or an
encyclopedia in ten volumes for your learning, you would probably
excite remark. But as you walk in the street, or sit in the corner of
the compartment behind a pipe, or “strap-hang” on the Subterranean,
who is to know that you are engaged in the most important of daily
acts?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea is to practise concentration. Bennett suggests a little bit
of Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus, who are both quite agreeable to me.

What kinds of questions lend themselves well to being thought about
while walking or taking the subway?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Base
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Review my values, priorities, and actions
</li>
<li>Review or make decisions

</li>
<li>Observe the world around me
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interesting products/services/needs/thoughts?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When I can read
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Read technology resources in order to learn more about tools I can use
</li>
<li>Review my sketchnotes and blog posts in order to revisit thoughts
</li>
<li>Review other people's sketchnotes in order to build my visual vocabulary and develop my eye
</li>
<li>Read and save blog posts from my subscriptions
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When I can write
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write a journal entry observing what happened that day, and then reflect on it
</li>
<li>Play around with blog post ideas
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not outlining because of difficulty of text manipulation
</li>
<li>Maybe coming up with titles and some rough notes
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Answer quick e-mails

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-99">
<p>
I'm fascinated by the challenge of understanding what people <b>mean</b>. I
realized this while looking at it from two different directions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When someone give an excuse like "It takes too much time," what's the excuse behind the excuse, and how can we address that?
</li>
<li>When someone gives a compliment like "Thank you for sharing an inspiring post," what kind of inspiring was it, and how can I get better at that?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let me start with the example of inspiration, because it's something I want to translate into concrete feedback and action. I thought about the different responses I have to things that inspire me.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16279222905/">2015-01-14 Understanding different types of inspiration &#x2013; index card #inspiration #breakdown</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Idea:</b> Inspiration might mean coming across something I didn't even
know I wanted. Now that I know it's possible, I can work toward it.
(This happens a lot with Emacs, which is why I like reading <a href="http://planet.emacsen.org/">Planet Emacsen</a>)
</li>
<li><b>Clarity:</b> Seeing other people who have reached my goals (or who've
travelled further down the path) helps me understand those goals
better. What do I really want? What are some ways I can get there? I
can see that more clearly thanks to other people who have
illuminated the path. (Talking to executives helped me realize I don't want to be one.)
</li>
<li><b>Alternatives:</b> Inspiration can help me see different ways of doing
something. For example, I looked at ways other people <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/exploring-sketchnote-colour-styles/">coloured their
sketchnotes</a> and picked several techniques to try.
</li>
<li><b>Beginning:</b> Inspiration can show me that something is less
intimidating than I thought it was. It can help me figure out a good
place to start and give me the courage to do it. Programming
tutorials help me get through the initial challenges of a new
framework.
</li>
<li><b>Action:</b> Inspiration can move me to act on something. I already
know it's a good idea and I've been meaning to do it, but sometimes
I need that extra push. Comments with questions and suggestions help
me a lot.
</li>
<li><b>Perseverance:</b> Sometimes I can feel lost or discouraged.
Remembering that other people have dealt with bigger challenges
helps me address my anxiety, focus on my goals or my progress, and
keep going. Anecdotes are easy to find.
</li>
<li><b>Hero worship:</b> I often come across stuff that looks so awesome, I
don't think I could ever do anything like it. This is the type of
"inspiration" we tend to get bombarded with. This is the least
useful kind of inspiration, I think. It takes a little work to
transform it into the kind of inspiration I can use: I need to
reflect on what part of it resonates with and how I can incorporate
a little of that into my life.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In what ways do I want to inspire others? How can I get better at that?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I like inspiring with <b>ideas</b>, playing with what's possible. I can get better at that by sharing more of these little tweaks.
</li>
<li>I think out loud in order to help people with <b>clarity</b>. I sketch out the reasons and consequences of my choices so that other people can learn without necessarily having to make all those choices themselves.
</li>
<li>I explore and summarize <b>alternatives</b> so that people can use that to figure out
</li>
</ul>
<p>
what might fit them. I can get better at that by researching what
other people have done, generating a few new ideas (possibly by
combining other ideas), and testing things out so that I can share my
experiences.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I break things down to help people with <b>beginning</b>. This is why I like addressing the "Yeah, but&#x2026;"s, the excuses, the things that get in people's way. This is also why I like sharing ideas, because that can help pull people forward.
</li>
<li>I'd love to get better at moving people to <b>action</b>. I haven't given this as much thought yet, but I think it's the most important.
</li>
<li>I don't have much to share in terms of <b>perseverance</b> - I've been very lucky and privileged.
</li>
<li>I definitely don't want to be in the region of <b>hero worship</b>. It creates too much distance and can shut down action.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Breaking a general statement down into more specific statements helps
me learn a lot. I ask myself: "hat would I or someone <b>say</b> that
captures a different aspect of this?" and I write that down. When I
split off different aspects, I can understand those aspects better,
and I can understand the whole thing better too.
</p>

<p>
This technique is good to use for excuses, too.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16093097739/">2015-01-14 Breaking down excuses &#x2013; index card #excuses #breakdown</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm getting better at catching myself when I give an excuse, drilling
down with "Why?" and splitting it out into different excuses. (I
guess, thanks to my parents' patience, my inner toddler never stopped
asking questions.) Then I can check if those excuses match what's
getting in my way, or if they don't resonate with me.
</p>

<p>
A technique I often use is to imagine <b>other people</b> giving those
excuses, since sometimes my mind is perfectly willing to ascribe
weakness to others even when it gets defensive about itself. ;)
</p>

<p>
I like sharing these excuses because that might help other people get
over theirs. It's often easier to <b>recognize</b> one of your excuses
instead of trying to articulate it yourself. "That's it! That's what's
getting in my way!" you might say. Or even if you don't find something
that completely fits, you might find something <b>close</b>, and then you
can ask yourself: "What's missing here?"
</p>

<p>
For example, what does it mean when someone says something "takes too
much time"? What's really getting in their way? Here are some ideas I
came up with:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16277442981/">2015-01-14 What does it mean when something takes too much time &#x2013; index card #excuses #breakdown</a>
</p>

<p>
"Too much time" is too vague to address. On the other hand, if you
think something takes too much time because you're trying to do
something complicated, you might be able to ask yourself: "What do I
really need? Can I get away with doing something simpler?" and then
reduce the task to something small enough for you to get started with.
</p>

<p>
Break things down. Find the statement behind the statement or the
excuse behind the excuse, and you'll have more to work with. Instead
of getting frustrated because you can't come up with one specific
answer, come up with lots of them, and then see if you recognize
yourself in any of them. Almost there, but not quite? Come up with
more answers, maybe combining aspects of the ones you already have.
This will not only help you understand yourself, but also understand
others&#x2013;and help others understand themselves and you.

This Quora question on <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-effective-way-to-read-a-book-and-what-can-one-do-after-reading">"What is the most effective way to read a book
and what can one do after reading?"</a> got me thinking about how I read
business books and what I do to make the most of them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16052555007/">2015.01.08 How to use what you read &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Application:</b> The best way to get value from a book is to apply it to
your life. Reading <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/02/visual-book-notes-the-lean-startup-by-eric-ries/">The Lean Startup</a> is one thing. Using its
Build-Measure-Learn loop to run a business experiment is another.
Reading <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/your-money-or-your-life-final-reflections/">Your Money or Your Life</a> is one thing. Calculating your true
hourly wage and using that to evaluate your expenses is another. Do
the work.
</p>

<p>
As you apply an idea, you'll probably want to refer back to the
details in the book, so it's good to keep the book itself handy. Write
notes about your questions, ideas, TODOs, experiences, and follow-up
questions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Visualization:</b> Not ready to do the work yet? Slow down and think
about it. Imagine the specific situations where you would be able to
apply the ideas from the book, and how you would do so. What do you
need to learn or do in order to get there? See if you can get closer
to being able to act on what you've learned.
</p>

<p>
Spend some time thinking about how the ideas in the book <b>connect</b> to
other books you've read or ideas you've explored. What do they agree
with or disagree with? Where do they go into more detail, and where do
they summarize? What new areas do they open up?
</p>

<p>
Think about specific <b>people</b> who might be able to use the ideas in
the book. Get in touch with them and recommend the book, explaining
why they might find it useful. Imagine what kind of conversation the
book might be relevant to so that you'll find it easier to recognize
the situation when it arises. (This is a tip I picked up from Tim
Sanders' <i>Love is the Killer App</i>, which I often recommend when people
want to know more about how reading helps with networking.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Review</b>: Can't act on the book yet, and can't think of specific
people or ideas to relate it to? Take notes so that you can review
them later, and maybe you'll be able to think of connections then.
</p>

<p>
I don't like writing in books. Here's why:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most of my books come from the library, and I'd never write in
those. This lets me get through <i>lots</i> of books without the friction
of committing money and space to them.
</li>
<li>Highlighting is an easy way to make yourself <i>think</i> that you're
going to remember something. Also, it's hard to decide what's
important the first time through, so you might end up highlighting
too much. When everything's important, nothing is.
</li>
<li>There's rarely enough room in the margins for notes, and you can't
review those notes quickly.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16051018450/">2015.01.09 Take notes while you read books &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
I prefer to write my notes on an index card or a piece of paper. If
I'm near my computer, I might draw my notes on a tablet or type quotes
into a text file. Keeping my notes separate from the book lets me
review my notes quickly without thumbing through the book. I want to
be able to refer to my notes while reading other books or while
writing my reflections. Index cards, pages, and print-outs are easy to
physically rearrange, and text files can be searched. Even if I read
an e-book, I take my own notes and I copy highlights into my text
files.
</p>

<p>
The best way to remember to review a book is to schedule an action to
apply an idea from it. The second-best way is to connect it to other
ideas or other people. If you don't have either of those hooks, you
can review on a regular basis - say, after a month, six months, and a
year, or by using a spaced repetition system. You might even pull a
book out at random and review your notes for inspiration. When you do,
see if you can think of new actions or connections, and you'll get
even more out of it.

Would you like to help me get better at helping you through blogging?
I'd love to hear your feedback. =)
</p>

<p>
I'm working on writing more posts that <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/start-titles-verb-make-stronger-reflections-titles-filler-phrases-life-gerund/">people might find useful</a>
instead of filling every week with my ruminations. One of my
challenges is that posts make sense to <i>me</i> (of course), but I'm sure
there are many people for whom the posts don't make sense. Sometimes
there are unanswered questions, or extraneous material that I could
move to a separate post. Maybe the flow doesn't make sense to other
people.
</p>

<p>
How can I learn how to step outside myself and read my writing with a
stranger's eyes? One way is to ask for help: if you can share your
thoughts (both content and style) on my posts through comments or
<a href="mailto:sacha@sachachua.com">e-mail</a>, that would be great. (Consider it an open invitation!) Another
way is to pay for help, especially if I can be clear about the kind of
feedback I want. (More logic than typos, please!) A third way is to
develop a list of questions that I can use to evaluate my own work.
</p>

<p>
Since this list of questions is useful for both paying for assistance
and editing things myself, I worked on drafting this list:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Title
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Does the post title start with a verb? Can you think of a more vivid verb to start it with?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bad: "Do stuff"
</li>
<li>Good:
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the post title help people decide whether this post is
relevant to them?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good: specific problem or tip
</li>
<li>Bad: generic or mysterious post title; title not clearly related to content
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Body
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Is the first paragraph focused on "you" (the reader)?
</li>
<li>Does the first paragraph or two help the reader quickly decide whether this post is relevant to them?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Good: Can tell right away whether this will be too introductory, too advanced, or covering something they already know
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do I share my background (context, etc.) in a way that helps
the reader understand what I've learned or how I can identify
with them?
</li>
<li>Do I share a useful tip that I have researched or personally experienced?
</li>
<li>Is the next step clear for the reader?
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>How it's said
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In your own words, what is the key point of this post?
</li>
<li>Is the key point sufficiently supported by the post? What kinds
of questions would a reader have about this post?
</li>
<li>Is there anything here that does not support the key point and
that can be removed?
</li>
<li>After reading this, what questions will the reader likely have?
What will they want to know next?
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Bonus
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Do I include research or links to other sources (not my blog)?
</li>
<li>Are there related links, and do they look interesting or useful?
</li>
</ol>
</li>

</p>

<p>
This particular post does <b>not</b> count as an other-directed post. It's
me trying to figure things out. =) The other-directed version of this
might be called something like "Use checklists to get better at
writing posts that other people will find useful" or "Pay for
perspective by hiring editors for your blog". My other-directed posts
start with a verb, and I usually schedule them for Thursdays. But if
you've got some ideas on how I can write better, I'd love to hear your
suggestions in the comments. Thanks!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-104">
<p>
You've written lots of blog posts, and maybe you've even organized
them using categories and tags. But your readers are still getting
lost. They like the posts they've found using search engines, but they
don't know where to go next. If they click on your categories or tags,
they see your newest posts, but they might not find your most useful
ones or figure out a good order to read posts in. Sure, if you wrote
all your posts according to a well-planned editorial calendar, people
can follow that sequence. (If only we could all be so organized!)
</p>

<p>
I know what that's like. I've got thousands of posts in my archive,
and even I find it hard to navigate through them. I've tried all sorts
of plugins for suggesting related posts, but I didn't find any that
could suggest good relevant content quickly.
</p>

<p>
How can we help people find the posts they need? Adding a "Popular
Posts" widget to the sidebar is one way to help people discover your
posts, but it only shows a handful of entries. A better way to help
lost readers is to put together a page with links to your recommended
posts. You can call it Resources, Start Here, or a similar title, and
add a prominent link to your menu or sidebar. Off the top of your
mind, you can probably think of a few blog posts to include on a
resources page. Add those to the page and start helping your readers.
</p>

<p>
When you have a little more time, gradually incorporate more links
into that page. You'll still want to highlight the key posts people
should begin with, but after that (short) list, you can add more lists
of recommended posts by topic. Choose your most important category and
review the posts within it. Copy the titles and links from your blog
posts and arrange them in a logical order, using either a list or an
outline. For example, you might go from a list like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Post 1
</li>
<li>Post 2
</li>
<li>Post 3
</li>
<li>Post 4
</li>
<li>Post 5
</li>
</ul>

<p>
to an outline like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Subtopic 1
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Post 1
</li>
<li>Post 3
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subtopic 2
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Post 2
</li>
<li>Post 4
</li>
<li>Post 5
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you get an overview of your posting history, you might find
opportunities to summarize several posts into a longer guide, update
and improve previous posts, and fill in the gaps with additional
posts. Add these ideas to your editorial calendar or idea notebook,
and use those ideas the next time you sit down to write.
</p>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15644688843/">2015.01.12 Reverse outlining &#x2013; index card #writing #organization #outlining</a>
</p>

<p>
For example, when I looked at what I'd written in my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/blogging">blogging</a>
category, I realized that I could organize these posts by the <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/02/excuses-guide-blogging/">excuses
they addressed</a>. Then it was easy to turn those excuses into a <a href="https://gum.co/no-excuses-blogging">short
guide</a>, which became something I could offer on my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/resources">resources</a> page. In
fact, I've been working on organizing all of my recent posts into a
massive <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/index">reverse outline or blog index</a>.
</p>

<p>
Building this kind of a "reverse outline" from your existing posts
helps you reuse what you've already published instead of starting from
scratch. Good luck!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-105" class="outline-4">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-105">
<p>
Do you have dozens of drafts languishing on your blog or on your computer?
</p>

<p>
I sometimes hear from other bloggers who say they just don't think
their posts are good enough. Maybe they've written a few paragraphs
before fizzling out. Maybe they've already written a full post, but
it's missing&#x2026; <i>something</i>.
</p>

<p>
Are you holding off because you're a perfectionist? Although research
shows that <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-procrastination-equation/201012/procrastination-and-the-perfectionism-myth">perfectionists actually procrastinate <b>less</b> than other
people do,</a> since blogs don't have deadlines, it's easy to dilly-dally.
You can always make something better.
</p>

<p>
Me, I am definitely not a perfectionist. I'm generally happy if I get
80% of the way to where I want to go. But I know what it's like to
hold a post back because I'm not sure if I'm expressing myself clearly
enough.
</p>

<p>
As I write this, there are nineteen drafts in my Wordpress interface
and countless more on my computer. The oldest draft I have in
Wordpress is from February 2014. Come to think of it, the time for
that topic has passed. Eighteen drafts now.
</p>

<p>
Do you want to know something that works better for me than drafting
posts?
</p>

<p>
Scheduling them.
</p>

<p>
In Lean Startup, there's this idea of a "Minimum Viable Product" - the
smallest thing you can build so that you can test your business
assumptions and get feedback from real customers. You can use this in
writing, too.
</p>

<p>
Instead of finely crafting and endlessly polishing each blog post, I
write a blog post that I'm <b>reasonably</b>&#x2013;not completely, just
reasonably&#x2013;happy with. I schedule it a few weeks out. You can do that
from the Wordpress edit screen - click on <b>Edit</b> near <b>Publish
immediately</b> and change it to the date you want. It's even easier with
the <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/09/working-with-the-editorial-calendar-plugin-for-wordpress/">Editorial Calendar plugin</a>, which lets you spread posts over weeks.
</p>

<p>
So then I have this imperfect post that will be published even if I
forget about it. My mind keeps working on it in the meantime. (Now
that I've learned about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluma_Zeigarnik">Zeigarnik effect</a>, I see it everywhere.)
Sometimes I come up with a thought I'd like to add. I might share a
scheduled post using the <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/10/blogging-tip-test-your-ideas-and-get-more-feedback-in-order-to-make-your-posts-better/">Share a Draft</a> plugin. Maybe I'll re-read the
post and find a typo to fix or a gap to fill.
</p>

<p>
And hey, even if it isn't the height of perfection when it finally
gets published, at least it's out there. Then people can tell me what
they found interesting or ask questions about what they didn't
understand.
</p>

<p>
You don't get that feedback if your thoughts are stuck in your drafts.
</p>

<p>
But what if you make a mistake? Edit your post. Even if you've already
published it, you can still edit it. (Many people add the date and a
description of what they changed.)
</p>

<p>
What if you turned out to be completely wrong about something? At
least you learned you were wrong.
</p>

<p>
What if you skipped over some things that you could have explainedq? Let
someone ask questions and pull that information from you.
</p>

<p>
Write (and schedule!) minimum viable posts: the simplest, roughest cut
of your ideas that will move you towards learning. You can treat the
schedule as your new deadline for improving the post.
</p>

<p>
Resist the temptation to reschedule posts again and again. If the
deadline is here and you still can't quite settle on your post,
publish it as is. Then listen to your dissatisfaction for clues to how
you can improve the <b>next</b> post.
</p>

<p>
Get stuff out there. Good luck!

<p>
I love how a calendar change gets so many people in the mood for
reflection, tallying up the past year and looking ahead to the new
one. A year is <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/building-better-time-machine/">enough distance to look at your past self</a> and notice
things that aren't obvious day to day. You can revisit your
predictions and the outcomes of decisions that unfold over time, as
suggested by Peter Drucker in <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/09/sketchnote-managing-oneself-peter-drucker/">"Managing Oneself"</a>. It's a good time
to celebrate any progress you've made and gently bring yourself back
on track where you've drifted off it. With time and attention, you
can <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/sketched-book-inner-game-work-w-timothy-gallwey/">guide your awareness</a> to the things you want to accomplish and
question the things you've glossed over.
</p>

<p>
If I've been doing my weekly and monthly reviews well, there should
be no surprises. But still, I forget so many things - my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/learning-effectively-exploring-various-unknowns/">unknown
knowns</a>. An annual review won't save them from the fog, but it might
help me connect more ideas. And I can think deliberately about the
things I want to learn and the kind of person I want to grow into,
which makes it easier to ask questions and gradually transform my
day-to-day life.
</p>

<p>
Taking a step back lets you see how far you've come &#x2013; and how much
other people have helped. Sharing your steps forward might help you
bump into co-adventurers so that you can swap tips. And then there's
the public commitment of saying, "Hey, this is what I'm doing this
year." Sometimes that's enough to push you into actually doing it.
</p>

<p>
So reviews are great for past and future, and they're good for
capturing the present, too: a snapshot of life, a sketch of your
routines and thoughts to help you look back after decades blur.
Other people take pictures. I like writing.
</p>

<p>
It's
  good for being able to empathize with people; otherwise, it can be
  hard to remember that you were ever anything but who you are now.

<b>Instead of using a generic title (ex: Top 10 Ways to &#x2026;), pick your strongest point and put that in the title as a clear recommendation.</b>
</p>

<p>
Now that I've gotten that promised tip out of the way, here's the
reflection that prompted this post.
</p>

<p>
Many bloggers focus on improving their titles as a way to encourage
people to click or share. Having repeatedly <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/writing-open-loops-closed-loops-working-forgetfulness/">run into the limitations</a>
of my blog searches and <a href="http://sachachua.com/index">index</a>, I've been thinking about blog post
titles as a way to make my blog posts more memorable - both in terms
of <b>retrieval</b> (remembering what to look for) and <b>recognition</b>
(recognizing it when I come across it).
</p>

<p>
That's why many of the usual title-writing tips don't appeal to me,
even if they're backed by <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-attract-more-clicks-blog-posts-title-tests-list">A/B testing</a>. List posts? A focus on new or
exclusive information? Mysterious headlines? While writing a post
called "10 New Emacs Productivity Tricks That Will Make Vim Users Hate
You - #2 Will Save You Hours!" is tempting to consider as an April
Fool's Joke, that kind of title is useless for me when I'm trying to
find things again. Any title generic enough to come out of a <a href="http://tweakyourbiz.com/tools/title-generator/index.php">blog post
title generator</a> is too generic for me to remember.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, there are plenty of role models on the Web when it comes
to writing clear, specific blog post titles. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> somehow
manages to do this well. Most of its posts start with a verb, even
when linking to a post that doesn't, and yet it doesn't feel
overbearing.
</p>

<p>
Here's a sample of Lifehacker titles for posts that summarize and link
to other posts (ignoring posts that were original guides, product
links, or fully-reposted blog posts):

<p>
Fascinating. Of the nine posts I looked at, all of them rewrote the
titles from the original blog posts so that they started with a verb,
making the titles more specific in the process. This makes sense in
the context of it being a lifehack, of course. The concept has action
at its core.
</p>

<p>
I like the new titles more. I can imagine that remembering and linking
to the Lifehacker-style titles would be easier than linking to the
original ones.
</p>

<p>
Most of my posts don't quite feel like those, though. I noticed that
most of my titles start with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund">gerunds</a>: thinking about, building,
learning, exploring, experimenting. I think it's because I write in
the middle of things, while I'm figuring things out. I don't feel
comfortable telling people what they should do. I share my notes and
let people come to their own conclusions. Starting a post with a verb
seems to be too direct, as if I'm telling you to do something.
</p>

<p>
That said, filler phrases like "Thinking about&#x2026;" aren't particularly
useful as part of a title, since the reflection is a given. But
changing "Thinking about how to make better use of Yasnippet in my
Emacs workflow" to "Save time with dynamic Yasnippets when typing
frequently-used text in Emacs" doesn't seem to accommodate the
exploratory bits, although it could be a good follow-up post. Changing
"Minimizing upward or downward skew in your sketchnotes" to "Minimize
upward or downward skew in your sketchnotes" feels like I'm making a
value judgment on skewed sketchnotes, when some people might like the
fact that an upward skew tends to feel happy and optimistic.
</p>

<p>
So I use nouns or gerunds when reflecting (which is self-directed),
and verbs when I'm trying to put together other-directed advice. This
helps me differentiate the types of posts in my index and in my
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/09/working-with-the-editorial-calendar-plugin-for-wordpress/">editorial calendar admin screen</a>, and it also signals the difference to
people as they browse. You might not be interested in my reflections
and prefer to focus on tips, for example, or you might be tired of
tips and want journal entries instead.
</p>

<p>
That works because those types of posts are generally quite separate.
When I want to help someone learn a technique such as <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/08/sketchnoting-tutorial-banners-and-ribbons/">sketching quick
ribbons</a>, I don't go on an extended tangent about how I learned how to
do that or how I want to improve. When I'm thinking about how I can
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/rethinking-delegation/">improve my delegation skills</a>, I don't expect someone to patiently go
through all of that in search of three concrete tips to help them
improve. I think that as I gain experience and become more opinionated
(the latter probably being more related to this), I'll write more
advice/instruction posts, possibly linking to those
personal-experience-and-reflection posts instead of going on internal
tangents.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I'm experimenting with a verb title while doing
extensive self-reflection. It feels a little odd, as if you started a
conversation with someone and then proceeded to talk to yourself, idly
musing out loud. You'll have to tell me if I should never do that
again, or if there's a way to manage the balance.
</p>

<p>
I figure there are plenty of other people out there who want to tell
you what to do with your life, and I'm not completely fond of that
approach anyway.
</p>

<p>
But I want to do <b>something</b> with my titles so that I don't end up
with lots of "Thinking about &#x2026;" and "Exploring &#x2026;" and "Deciding
between &#x2026;" in my index. My ideal for these reflection posts, I
think, would be a clear, concise summary of the key insight (perhaps
saving it as an excerpt). If I followed that up with an other-directed
post with a crisp title that started with a verb, made the
recommendation, brought in some research and observations, and linked
to my reflection, that would give me a good, logical, memorable,
useful chunk that I could share with other people.
</p>

<p>
Right. That makes sense to me. If I address you with a direct verb or
"How to &#x2026;", I should deliver a post that requires minimal mental
translation for you to get good tips out of it. If I clearly mark
something as a reflection, you know what to expect. I tend to remember
them as actions I decided to take ("The time I resolved to&#x2026;") or the
particular new thing I came to understand. I can take a few minutes to
update the titles and summaries accordingly, which could help me years
later when I'm trying to make sense of things again.
</p>

<p>
In Buckminister's rather odd book <i>I Seem to Be a Verb</i> (1970), he wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I
am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an
evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A verb seems too definite for me. I'm a gerund in at least two senses,
I think: reflexive, the way "I read" is an act but "reading" is a noun
that lets us talk about itself; and in the process of doing, not done.

<b>I think I've written about something before, but I can't find it.</b> I
have thirteen tabs open with Google search results from my blog.
I've tried countless keywords and synonyms. I've skimmed through
posts I only half-remember writing. (Was that blog post really that
short? I thought I wrote more details.) I still haven't found the
post I want.
</p>

<p>
I wonder: <b>Did I really publish it?</b> Or did I just outline or sketch
it? Am I confusing it with something similar that I wrote, or
someone else's post that I admired?
</p>

<p>
<b>Ah, well, time to write it from scratch.</b> It's a little like writing
code. Sometimes it would take so long to find an appropriate open
source module that you're better off just writing the code yourself.
Sometimes it would take so long to find an existing post that it's
better to just write it from scratch.
</p>

<p>
I was looking for that particular post because of a conversation with
Flavian de Lima where I mentioned the benefits of blogging while
you're learning something. He resonated with the idea of sharing your
notes along the way so that other people can learn from them, even if
you've moved on to different topics.
</p>

<p>
Despite having a clear memory of writing about this topic, when I went
to the post that I <i>thought</i> was related to it (<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/spiral-learning/">spiral learning</a>), it
didn't mention blogging at all. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/share-learn/">"Share while you learn"</a> didn't quite
address it, either. After trying lots of searches, I gave up and
started writing a new post. After all, <b><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/18/health/lifeswork-loftus-memory-malleability/index.html">memories are fallible</a></b>; you
could have full confidence in an imagined event.
</p>

<p>
The reason this came up was because Flavian described how he often
took advantage of <b>open loops</b> when working on writing. He would stop
with an incomplete thought, put the draft away, and let his
subconscious continue working on it. Sometimes it would be days or
weeks before he got back to working on the article. He mentioned how
other authors might take years to work on novels, dusting off their
manuscripts and revising scenes here and there.
</p>

<p>
<b>Keeping loops open by stopping mid-sentence or mid-task</b> is a useful
technique often recommended for writing or programming. Research
describes this as the <a href="http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Zeigarnik_Effect">Zeigarnik effect</a>: an interrupted task stays in
your memory and motivates you to complete it.
</p>

<p>
But after reading David Allen's <i>Getting Things Done</i>, I had become
a convert of <b>closed loops</b>: getting tasks, ideas, notes out of your
head and into a trusted system so that you don't have to waste
energy trying to remember them. I noticed that if I kept too many
loops open, my mind felt buzzy and distracted. To work around this,
I got very good at writing things down.
</p>

<p>
I even took it one step further. Publishing my notes on my blog helped
me get rid of the guilt and frustration I used to feel whenever I
found myself wanting to move on to a different project. Because my
notes were freely available for anyone who was trying to figure out
the same thing, I could go ahead and follow the butterflies of my
interest to a different topic. My notes could also help me pick things
up again if I wanted to.
</p>

<p>
I didn't stop mid-sentence or mid-thought, but <b>I published in the
middle of learning</b> instead of waiting until I finished. Even my
review posts often included next steps and open questions. So I got a
little satisfaction from posting each small chunk, but I still left
dangling threads for me to follow up on. I closed the loops enough so
that the topics didn't demand my attention.
</p>

<p>
<b>Writing helped me clear my mind of strong open loops&#x2013;but it worked a
little too well</b>. I tried to close things off quickly, so that I could
revisit them when I wanted to. The trick was remembering that they
were there. Sometimes I forget the dangling threads for a year or
more. I never followed up on others. Even with my regular review
processes, I often forgot what I had written, as in the search that
prompted this post.
</p>

<p>
Writing and memory have an ancient trade-off. Even Socrates had
something to say about it in Plato's <i>The Phaedrus</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the
learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories; they will
trust to the external written characters and not remember of
themselves.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
as quoted in <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2012/04/30/on-writing-memory-and-forgetting-socrates-and-hemingway-take-on-zeigarnik/">On writing, memory, and forgetting: Socrates and Hemingway take on Zeigarnik</a>
</p>

<p>
In 2011, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_effect">Sparrow, Liu,
and Wegner</a> showed that people remember less if they think a computer
will keep their notes for them, and they tend to remember how to get
to the information rather than the information itself. Having written
the words, published the posts, and indexed the titles, I've forgotten
the words; and now I can't find my way back.
</p>

<p>
Hence my immediate challenge: <b>sometimes I forget how to get to the information I've stored</b>, like a squirrel stashing nuts.
(More research: <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/11/981126102802.htm">tree squirrels can't find 74% of the nuts they
bury</a>. So I'm doing slightly better than a squirrel, I think.)
</p>

<p>
Google helps if I can remember a few words from the post, but since
it tends to search for exact words, I have to get those words right.
Hah, maybe I need to use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques
like writing with different keywords &#x2013; not for marketing, but for
my own memory. It reminds me of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/twitters-best-joke-an-seo-copywriter-walks-into-a-bar/69419/">this SEO joke</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
How many SEO copywriters does it take to change a lightbulb, light bulb, light, bulb, lamp, bulbs, flowers, flour&#x2026;?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My <a href="http://sachachua.com/index">blog index</a> is helpful, but it isn't enough. I need to write more descriptive titles. Perhaps I should summarize the key point as well. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/11/mapping-what-im-learning/">Maps</a> can help, as can other <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/deliberately-making-sense/?shareadraft=baba27724_549b4095bcbe4">deliberate ways of connecting ideas</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Let me take a step back and look at my goals here.</b> Linking to posts
helps me save time explaining ideas, build on previous
understanding, and make it easy for people to dig into more detail
if they want. But I can also accomplish these goals by <b>linking to other people's explanations</b>. With so many people writing on the Web,
chances are that I'll find someone who has written about the topic
using the words I'm looking for. I can also <b>write a new post from scratch</b>, which has the advantages of being tailored to a specific
question and which possibly integrates the forgotten thoughts even
without explicit links.
</p>

<p>
It's an acceptable trade-off, I think. <b>I'll continue writing, even
with the increased risk of forgetting.</b> If I have to write from
scratch even when I think I've probably written about the same topic
before, I can accept that as practice in writing and thinking.
</p>

<p>
Other writers have better memories. Flavian told me how he can
remember articles he wrote in the 1990s, and I've heard similar
accounts from others. Me, I've been re-reading this year's blog posts
in preparation for my annual review, and I've come across ones that
pleasantly surprised me. Posts two or three years back are even
fuzzier in my memory. I can try to strengthen my memory through
exercises and processes. The rest of the time, I can work with the
brain that I have. In fact, I'm inclined to build more memory
scaffolds around myself,
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/02/moving-my-memory-outside-my-brain/">moving
more of my memory outside my mind</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[I do not] carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books. &#x2026;The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, as Wikiquotes cites from <i>Einstein His Life and Universe</i> (2007)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And really, how much difference would perfect memory make? I might add
more links, include more citations, cover more new ground. I can still
learn and share without it.
</p>

<p>
Forgetful squirrels have their uses. Forgotten acorns grow into oaks
for others to enjoy. From time to time, I hear from people who've come
across old posts through search engines, or I come across old posts in
a review. Loops re-open, dangling threads are taken up again, and we
continue.

<p>
If you know what you want to do, you can figure out what you need to
read to get there.
</p>

<p>
This tip might be obvious to other people, but I'm not used to
planning my reading so that the books are aligned with an overall
goal.
</p>

<p>
I make lots of <a href="http://sach.ac/my-learning">learning plans</a>, with various degrees of following
through. Those plans tend to go out the window when I browse through
the monthly new release lists on the library website or come across
mentions from bibliographies and blog posts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Books are my equivalent of impulse purchases at the supermarket checkout</b>, the pull of slot machines, the intrigue of Kinder eggs. I
think that's how I resist temptations like that. The library is where
I let that impulse out to play.
</p>

<p>
We've checked out more than 400 books from the library this year. I've
skimmed through most of them, although I've taken notes from a much
smaller collection.
</p>

<p>
Since there's such a trove of free resources I can go through, <b>I find
it difficult to spend on books</b>. The last time I bought a book was
November 2013. I suspect this is silly. The cost of a book is almost
always less than the cost of taking the author out to lunch for
discussion and brain-picking (and that's pretty much Not Going to
Happen anyway). It's certainly less than the cost of figuring things
out myself.
</p>

<p>
My reluctance often comes from an uncertainty about whether there'll
be enough in the book, or whether it'll be the same concepts I've
already read about, just given new clothes. <b>I have to remember that I
can get more out of a book than what the author put into it.</b> A book
isn't just a collection of insights. It's a list of questions to
explore. It's a bibliography. It's a link in the conversation and a
shorthand for concepts. It's an education on writing style and
organization. It's sketchnoting practice and raw material for blog
posts. It's fuel for connection.
</p>

<p>
<b>Phrased that way, books are a bargain.</b> Even not particularly good
ones. Hmm. Maybe I should take the "Connection" part of my budget -
the part that I'm supposed to be forcing myself to use for taking
people out to coffee or lunch, the part that I never end up using all
that much anyway - and experiment with using it for books.
</p>

<p>
I'm more comfortable when I use my money deliberately, so I also want
to <b>be deliberate about the books I buy</b>. All books are bought - some
with money, but all with time. This requires a plan, and this requires
follow-through.
</p>

<p>
<b>There are holes in the way I learn from books</b>, the pipeline from
acquisition to reading to notes to action to review. I want to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/10/becoming-better-reader/">become
a better reader</a>. My inner cheapskate says: practise on free books. But
money can be a useful form of commitment too.
</p>

<p>
Anyway. A plan. It seems logical to decide on what I should
proactively seek out and read by thinking about what I want to do. It
also seems logical to <b>require proof of my learning</b> through writing
blog posts and resources and maybe even books, the way students focus
on final projects and consultants are measured by deliverables.
</p>

<p>
Here are some ideas for things I want to create out of what I want to
learn:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>An approach for learning intermediate Emacs:</b> After you've gotten
the hang of the basics, how can you keep learning more about using
and tweaking this text editor? This will probably take many forms:
small weekly tips for constant improvement, Emacs Lisp and Org Mode
courses, and so forth.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What is the change I want to make in myself?</b> After doing this, I
want to be an even better user of Emacs. I want to work more
efficiently and fluently, and I want to have more fun with it too.
</li>
<li><b>Who might find it useful?</b> People who want to keep tweaking how
they use Emacs. Mostly developers, but probably also writers and
people interested in personal information management
</li>
<li>To do this, it would be good to read:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Archives of Emacs blogs (ex: the ones featured on
<a href="http://planet.emacsen.org/">http://planet.emacsen.org/</a>)
</li>
<li>Manuals for Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and popular packages
</li>
<li>the (small) collection of existing Emacs books
</li>
<li>Related technical books for taking people beyond the beginner stage
</li>
<li>Books about technical writing and learning design
</li>
<li>Source code
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>A guide for creating your own personal knowledge management
system:</b> I doubt that a one-size-fits-all solution will work, at
least not with our current understanding. But I want to learn more
about different approaches, I want to make mine totally awesome, and
I want to help people build their own from the pieces that are
already out there.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What is the change I want to make in myself?</b> After doing this, I
want to have a wonderfully organized system that lets me easily
capture, review, make sense of, and share what I know. I also want
to have the vocabulary and concepts to be able to critically
examine this system, spot gaps or opportunities for improvement,
and make things better.
</li>
<li><b>Who would find this useful?</b> Fellow information packrats,
writers, bloggers, self-directed learners

<li>Writing and sense-making
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Tips for self-directed learning and experimentation:</b> How to
structure your time and learning, how to recognize and explore
interesting questions, how to take notes, how to make sense of
things, and so on. I want to learn more effectively, and I want to
help other people learn more effectively too.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What is the change I want to make in myself?</b> After doing this, I
want to be able to structure courses of study for myself, take
great notes, build useful resources, and accumulate new knowledge.
</li>
<li><b>Who would find this useful?</b> Self-directed learners who want
something more than online courses
</li>
<li>To do this, it would be good to read about:

<li>Note-taking and sense-making
</li>
<li>Self-directed learning
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>More notes on working out loud:</b> particularly addressing the
excuses and barriers that get in people's way. To do this, it would
be good to read about:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What is the change I want to make in myself?</b> After doing this, I
want to have a smooth workflow for learning and sharing. I want to
have a wide network of people who can build on the stuff I'm
learning about, and who get manageable updates that are scoped to
their interests.
</li>
<li><b>Who would find this useful?</b> Individual practitioners interested
in building their skills and network; social business advocates;

thoughts, remember, and share. To do this, it would be good to read
about:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What is the change I want to make in myself?</b> After doing this, I
want to be more fluent in using visual tools to explore thoughts
and figure things out. I want to improve in terms of visual
organization, technique, clarity, explanation, integration into my
self-directed workflow, and so on.
</li>
<li><b>Who would find this useful?</b> People who've already started
doodling (or who are picking up the hang of it) and who would like
to use it for more things

</li>
<li>Information organization and sense-making
</li>

<li><b>Something about how to follow the butterflies of your interest</b>,
because I rarely see this perspective in productivity books and
because it's something other people might find helpful.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What is the change I want to make in myself?</b> I want to get
better at going with the grain of my energy, doing what I want to
do (and doing the work that helps me want what is good to want).
</li>
<li><b>Who would find this useful?</b> People with many interests -
scanners, multi-potentialites, Renaissance-people-to-be.

<li>To do this, it would be good to read about:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Career and life planning, especially unconventional paths

<li>Writing, note-taking
</li>
<li>Psychology, cognitive limits, distraction
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmm. I've done literature reviews before, collecting quotes and
references and connecting things to each other. I can do that again.
It doesn't mean giving up my impulse reads, my openness to serendipity
and surprise. It simply means choosing something I want to learn more
about and then taking it all in, with more awareness and less
evaluation, so that I can get a sense of the whole. This will help me
find the things that have already been written so that I don't have to
write them again. This will help me collect different approaches and
ideas so that I can springboard off them.
</p>

<p>
I like books with references more than I like books without them.
Books without references feel like they float unanchored in a
conversation. I recognize ideas but feel weird about the lack of
attribution. There are no links where I can explore a concept in
depth. On the other hand, too many references and quotes make a book
feel like a pastiche with little added, a collection of quotes glued
together with bubblegum and string. A good balance makes a book feel
like it builds on what has gone before while adding something new. I
want to write books and resources like that, and if I'm going to do
so, I need notes so that I can trace ideas back to where people can
learn more about them, and so I can make sense of that conversation as
a whole. Looking forward to this.
</p>

<p>
What topics will you read about in 2015, and why? What are the changes
you want to make in yourself, what are the resources you can build for
others, and what books can you build on to get there?

Have you felt envy as a writer?
</p>

<p>
I often come across blog posts or books that I wish I'd written. They
explain, clearly and in depth, ideas that I've been noodling about
writing.
</p>

<p>
I want to have written Aaron's <a href="http://profoundreading.com/re-reading/">"What's better than reading?
Re-reading"</a>. Jon Snader (Irreal)'s summaries of Emacs chats, like this
one with <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=3496">Karl Voit</a>. Kate Stull's <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-most-important-thing-youre-not-doing-at-work-and-how-to-get-started">guide to taking notes at work</a>.
</p>

<p>
And that's just from three days of blog posts.
</p>

<p>
My inner critic goes, "What have I been doing with my life?" and "How
do I get there from here?" After I remind it that I'm learning, I feel
okay. A little. I don't feel like a complete waste.
</p>

<p>
And I haven't been scooped. I haven't lost an opportunity to explore
that thought for myself and create something possibly useful for
people. One look at the library shelves or my blog reader, and I
remember that there is room in the world for many people writing about
the same things.
</p>

<p>
When the frustration fades, only delight is left.
</p>

<p>
I get to benefit from other people's perspectives, research,
experiences, and styles. I get to write the next step, linking to
what's already been written instead of explaining it myself. I get to
learn what I like without the hard work of writing and revising it
myself.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I've learned from recognizing the self I want to be in
other people's words:
</p>

<p>
I like short paragraphs and short words. I like practical application.
I like specifics and personal experiences. I like flows.
</p>

<p>
There will always be a gap between what I can do and what I want to
do, and that's a good thing.

<p>
Sometimes, when I feel my mind filling up with thoughts of other people (tasks, questions, ideas for helping), I take a step back and focus on something more selfish. It's important to me that I sometimes write mainly for myself. If it so happens to benefit other people, wonderful, but it's got to be stuff that I need too.
</p>

<p>
What are the kinds of things I write about when I'm writing for myself?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Notes on things that I'm figuring out
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Idiosyncratic interests that hardly anyone will find useful
</li>
<li>Puzzling through the tangles of life
</li>
<li>Straightforward questions and the journey towards answers, including research and backtracking
</li>
<li>Plans, scenarios
</li>
<li>Data analysis
</li>
<li>Things I'm learning, in case other people want to help out (and sometimes people can learn from it too, which is nice)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things I want to remember
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reasons for decisions and expected outcomes
</li>
<li>What this experiment feels like

</ul>

<p>
Based on a quick scan of the <a href="http://sachachua.com/2014">blog posts this year</a>, I'd say that around 25% of my blog posts have been mostly for me rather than other people (excluding weekly and monthly reviews from the count). This is higher than I thought it would be, and I think that's good. It's probably just the buzz from e-mail and from a recent experiment tilting my blog towards more technical topics.

<p>
Based on my time records, drawing has been on a decline (62.6h in Jan, 34.7h in Feb, 18.2h in March, 12h in April), while Emacs has been on the increase. In fact, the correlation is -0.86 over five months. Interestingly, the only negative correlation for sleep in my top 10 activities is with Emacs: -0.43. Pretty strong positive correlations for sleep with work and writing. I probably like a balance like March, where I mixed things up a bit more with personal reflections. Hmm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Okay. So maybe I dial back a <i>little</i> on the Emacs side, and do more drawing and writing as an experiment to see how that affects buzz. That probably means that Wednesdays and maybe a bit of Friday will be for Emacs (course, e-mail, blog posts, tinkering). Mondays and a bit of Friday will be for planning. Ideally, we'll get to the point where I don't feel a smidge of guilt for my inbox or limited ability to explain things, so it's all upside. =)
</p>

<p>
If I set the expectation that I mostly care about my inbox only every 2-3 days (and that I sometimes take a week to reply), I think that will un-buzz-ify my brain enough. It'll be interesting to see if I can still run an engaging e-mail course with those bounds. I like the conversation. I don't want to give that up. =) I just want to make sure my brain has the quiet it needs for other things, too.
</p>

<p>
What's the quiet for? I want to be able to catch myself being confused, to see the gaps, to say, "Hmm, that's a good question," and to dig into things further. What am I likely to find interesting after ten years? Easy enough to compare <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/04">April 2014</a> with <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2004/04">April 2004</a> (technical posts, snippets, links, teaching, flash fiction), March with March, and so on. I like the mix of March 2014 mix more than April's. More exploratory, maybe? Hmm&#x2026;

<p>
There's a strong correlation (0.84) between the number of visits and the number of comments, which makes sense. There is, however, practically no correlation between the percentage of posts I write for other people and how many posts or visits I get. My Feedburner stats show that my other-focused tend to get clicked on more, although some of my reflective posts are also popular.
Anecdotally, I see my other-focused posts shared on Twitter more often, which makes sense too.
</p>

<p>
Google Analytics lets me look at stats for individual pages, so I
analyzed the stats for July. This doesn't count the times when people
read the entirety of the post on the homepage, just when they view the
individual post by clicking on the link. I looked at the top 100 pages
in terms of number of visits. I classified 70 of those as
"other-focused" and 12 of those as "self-focused". The top
self-focused posts got an average of 143 views per page, while the top
other-focused posts got an average of 233 posts per page. People also
spent an average of 1.7 minutes longer on those pages (5 minutes vs
3.3 minutes).

What makes good posts like that?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The posts that spread widely tend to be the ones that are visual: the Shy Connector, a Teacher's Guide to Web 2.0 at School, How to Learn Emacs, sketchnotes, sketchnoting tips, and visual book reviews.
</li>
<li>The posts that are surprisingly popular over a long period of time are my technical notes: Emacs, Drupal, Rails, Lotus Notes, and so on. You'd expect them to be superseded by better documentation or changing technology (and sometimes they are), but they tend to endure.
</li>
<li>Sometimes my personal thinking-through-stuff posts unexpectedly resonate with people, and people share their comments and insights. (Ex: <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/03/passion-and-uncertainty/">Passion and uncertainty</a>)
</li>
<li>I don't have to write advice posts from a position of authority ("You should do this, you should do that") in order to be useful. I can create value by:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Describing what's out there (sketchnotes, visual book reviews)
</li>
<li>Sharing my technical troubleshooting notes, work-arounds, hacks, or discoveries from reading documentation/code
</li>
<li>Applying advice to my life and sharing my experiences
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What would success look and feel like?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm going to be selfish about this because I can. =)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is it okay to say that I blog more for myself? Because I do. Although your comments, shares, and links are nice. I feel like I should say that I write for readers. Attention is a gift. Many people would say that attention is valuable, and then turn around and try to sell you something.
</li>
<li>Someday, perhaps, when I have something I want to tell people, and I acquire a Voice of Advice, then I'll write more for other people.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When would I feel good about that?
</li>
<li>Is there something I feel good about?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I feel comfortable giving people advice on learning, reading, making better decisions, trying things out, and sharing.
</li>
<li>I feel comfortable helping people learn more about Emacs, Wordpress, and a little Excel.
</li>
<li>I feel comfortable that drawing is another way to create value.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the meantime
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If I want to invest more time in writing&#x2026;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I would write about things that few people write about
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emacs? Visual thinking? What it's like to make blogging such a part of your learning?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawing, right&#x2026; Although Sketchnote Army does pretty well.
</li>
<li>Something else.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>False dilemma. (Trilemma?) I know. The choice isn't really between these options, and I don't have to make one choice. I can write about all these things in the course of a week. But I wanted to figure out, if I wasn't keen on the first two options, what <i>am</i> I leaning towards, so I can intentionally work on it?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A post that makes me a better person
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change
</li>
<li>The posts I write make me at least a teensy bit better
</li>
<li>Better
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Better at learning and sharing
</li>
<li>Better at making decisions
</li>
<li>Better at resilience and positivity
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In terms of outcome
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Blog posts that represent larger chunks of growing (going from 0.01% to 0.1%)?
Improving by 0.01% every day means getting 4% better in a year, if you're fine with simplified math. Improving by 0.1% every day means getting 44% better in a year!
</li>
<li>One way to do this is to write less, to sit on posts longer until they develop, to start with a hundred ideas and tweak them for days or weeks (or longer!) until they're deep and insightful and useful.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write less? No, I like writing almost every day, and I forget if I don't write things down. &#x2013;verbose Stuff gets lost in my private notes. Here, we might have conversations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Arguing against myself: reasons for posting earlier rather than later
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn from the conversation
</li>
<li>Get feedback
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is it something unusual worth digging into?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flesh things out on demand (in response to people's questions, etc.)
</li>
<li>Get good value from time (diminishing returns?) - 80%
</li>
<li>Throw more pots
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deliberate practice, engagement
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another way to get a feel for what these deeper posts would be like would be to summarize experiences and update them with lessons learned
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, things I've learned in the past ten years, like cooking.
</li>
<li>This will give me a feel for what deeper posts might feel like.
</li>
<li>Then I can play with timeframes
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It would be worth getting the hang of this for new ideas, though.
</li>
<li>So I need to get better at getting better.
</li>
<li>Well, maybe an order of magnitude is ambitious. (0.01% to 0.1% is 10 times!) What would "a little better" look like?
</li>
<li>Grow more
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask better questions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Know what "better" looks like and what direction it's in
</li>
<li>Ask the questions behind the questions
</li>
<li>Ask <i>different</i> questions
</li>
<li>See and question assumptions
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Research
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Books, blog posts, other resources
</li>
<li>Reaching out to people (!)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Observe
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Notice
</li>
<li>Describe
</li>
<li>Be less worried
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try things out
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All that considered, I still want to write in small increments
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Behind the scenes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's like the way I take sketchnotes. I try to capture as much as I can instead of summarizing it, because you can summarize based on your notes but it's hard to go the other way around.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I love being able to link to posts from years ago when I was still figuring something out
</li>
<li>There are plenty of people who'll share advice &#x2013; the results of their experiences &#x2013; without sharing (or remembering!) much of the journey along the way.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So what's next for me then?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Getting better at getting better
</li>
<li>Letting outlines steep
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think I like leaving outlines hanging - it gives me something to focus on while doing the dishes or other chores
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But not too navel-gazey
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Something I want to remember
</li>
<li>&#x2026; but not too much pressure here, mind you, or I'll probably be unable to write <i>anything</i>. So it doesn't have to Measurably Improve the Human Condition.

Also, another note from 2004: My notes were shorter and more plentiful
back when I didn't think of it as a blog, just my notebook. That could
be handy to bring back. But I like the depth of exploring an idea in a
longer post, and I like the way sketches help me build up to more
complex ideas too. Perhaps a tidbits category that's not included in
the stream, a combination of a web log and features à la BoingBoing
(although not as awesome)? One thing I've learned in the past ten
years is that if it isn't public, it's hard to remember or keep.

<p>
Here's my evolving break-down of blogging-related skills, including
notes for future blog posts. I'm currently working on getting better
at <b>outlining</b> (from high-level down to chunks of ~100 words)
and <b>synthesizing</b> (especially combining other people's insights with
my experiences). I'm using this outline to think of ways to
deliberately practise certain aspects of blogging, to plan posts that
will help people learn, and to clarify what I would like to delegate
to assistants or work with coaches for.

<p>
I've been thinking about my goals for blogging because I want to get better. I write almost every day, fueled by habits of reading and experimenting. I have time to learn things, and I can learn more effectively if I learn deliberately. Here's what I'm learning about being clear about your goals and analyzing how your actions match up with them.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="unnumbered-137"></a>1. Clarify your goals<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-137">
<p>
It's good to know what your goals are and how the different approaches serve those goals so that you can choose the ones that are the most effective. You can also look at each approach to see how you can improve it.
</p>

<p>
After some reflection, I came up with this list of goals for my blog:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learn more effectively by thinking through complexity or explaining what I'm learning
</li>
<li>Explore assumptions and possibilities; become more aware of them myself, and help other people see them
</li>
<li>Improve core skills through practice: making decisions, explaining ideas, organizing thoughts, etc.
</li>
<li>Save myself and other people time spent re-solving the same problems or learning the same things
</li>
<li>Build a long-term archive that I can use to remember what I'm learning and see differences over time
</li>
<li>Learn from other people through questions, comments, and conversations
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Your list of goals will probably look different. Many people have goals such as building a business by promoting their products or services, educating clients or readers, keeping family members up to date, working through difficult issues by writing anonymously, and so on. Take a moment to think about and prioritize your goals.
</p>

<p>
If you're having problems expressing your goals, you can also take a look at your recent blog posts and ask yourself, "Why did I write this?" What results did you want to get? What purpose did it serve? One blog post might work towards several different goals.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="unnumbered-138"></a>2. Analyze the ways you approach those goals<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-138">
<p>
Different actions support different goals to different extents. Think about the different types of blog posts you write. Score them against each of your goals on a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 5 means that type of post helps a specific goal a lot, while 1 means it does very little or even nothing for that particular goal.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the types of posts I share and how they line up with the goals I listed above:

<p>
Sorting the table by the total score makes it easy to see which approaches you value more. If some goals are much more important to you than others, you can also weight those goals in your calculations. For example, if building a long-term archive was twice as important to me, I could double that column when calculating the total score.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this ranking makes it clearer why I feel good about original drawings and sketchnotes, and why I skew towards decision reviews and "thinking through things"-type posts even if they don't feel focused enough on saving other people time. Most of the blogging advice tends to focus on writing tips, but they don't motivate me as much.
</p>

<p>
How about you? Do your post types match up with your goals? Are there clear winners that you should focus on? You can write lower-value posts from time to time because they address different needs. For example, I post weekly reviews because they're useful to me even if they're less useful for others.
</p>

<li><a id="unnumbered-139"></a>3. Adjust your priorities based on feedback<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-139">
<p>
Of course, since these values are subjective, it helps to adjust them based on your website analytics or feedback from your readers. For example, if you think a type of post saves people a lot of time, you'll probably see a lot of visits or comments on it. If you have Google Analytics, you can export the <b>Content - Site Content - All Pages</b> table to a spreadsheet, classify the top X links, and then see what types of posts people spend their time on. For example, I analyzed the top 500 pages visited in July 2013, classified each by type, calculated average views and time per page, and sorted it by average views to get a sense of which posts tend to be more popular.

My sketchnotes are more popular by far. My technical notes are surprisingly durable over time, even though you'd expect them to be superseded by bugfixes, technical changes, better documentation, and so on. Posts as old as 2004 still turn up. Because people still get a lot of value from my old tech posts, I adjusted the "Save time" rating for tech tips from my original value of 3 to 4. (I had started with a lower value because I figured that not a lot of people would probably have run into the same issues I did, but it turns out that time makes up for audience size and the long tail works.) As I expected, tips that few other people have written about get more pageviews than tips that more people have written about, although I'm surprised that people tend to spend more time on the common tips. My "thinking out loud" posts are more popular than I expected. (Limitations: This only looks at single-page views in a single month.) Also, people tend to click on my weekly reviews if I add a brief description to the title, so that's something.
</p>

<p>
Anecdotally speaking, I get a lot of comments and links to my sketchnotes. I'm also delighted by the conversations that occasionally grow out of the "thinking out loud" posts, and how sometimes people will share even better solutions when I post my technical notes.

<li><a id="unnumbered-140"></a>4. Identify ways to improve each approach<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-140">
<p>
Now that you've looked at what makes each type of post different, you can focus on how to improve each type by building on its strengths or compensating for its weaknesses. Here's what I'm planning for the kinds of posts I write:
</p>

<p>
<b>Draw original stuff</b>: It takes me 2-4 hours to make one of these. I like making technical notes (ex: Emacs), sketchnote tutorials (to help people draw more), and other drawings related to life and planning. I'm getting used to drawing them with less up-front planning. Even though I end up moving things around, I think it's useful to just get started. Drawing involves a trade-off because images are not as searchable as text. I can fix that by including the text, but it's a little awkward and it takes more time. Still, people like the drawings a lot, and I like them too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Draw book reviews and events:</b> I go to fewer events these days, but I'm reading a lot more books. It takes me two hours to read a typical business book in depth, drawing notes along the way. I tend to draw book reviews only when I've already gotten a sense that a book is worth reading in depth. One way to increase my frequency is to draw book notes based on the skimmed parts of books that I'm not reading deeply - perhaps breaking out just the chapter or idea that resonates with me, and using that to illustrate a blog post reflecting on it. I can also work on getting more high-quality books into my pipeline, or practise by drawing more books with fewer value judgments.
</p>

<p>
<b>Think out loud:</b> I can improve the "Save time" score by stashing the notes in my outline, adding observations, until I've fleshed it out enough for preliminary findings and advice. It means that the output will be more concise in its reasoning and I'll have to do more learning on my own instead of opening up the conversation early, but then the posts will be useful for other people as well as for me. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> is a good example of a blog that mixes personal stories and useful observations. The main thing that was holding me back from doing this before was losing track of my drafts, but my outline is a good step.
</p>

<p>
For example, this post started as a rough outline, thinking out loud about what kinds of posts I wanted to write. Now I'm going back and filling it in with other information that might be useful for people. If it ends up too long, I might have to trim it. We'll get there!
</p>

<p>
<b>Share tech tips, troubleshooting notes, or code:</b> The limiting factor here is that I'm not working on any professional projects that I can write about, so I'm forced to run into and resolve fewer issues. I can replace that with working on my own projects or on open source projects, or helping people with questions. I often tweak or work on things related to Emacs, Wordpress, or data visualization, so there's that. If I set aside time and find a good source of small bugs so that I can ease my way into a habit of contributing to open source again, then that will also help me with my life goal to keep my technical skills sharp.
</p>

<p>
<b>Review longer spans of time:</b> I can increase the frequency of decision reviews by scheduling them so that I don't lose track of items. Because I manage my outline in Org Mode, that should be relatively easy to do. I can also bootstrap this by reviewing last year and last decade's monthly reviews (if available), or the blog posts if not. I have an advantage here because I have a lot of public notes over the years.
</p>

<p>
<b>Write tips that few other people can cover:</b> There are lots of information gaps to fill. Sometimes it's because people don't have the time, inclination, or confidence to write about something. Sometimes it's because I have a useful combination of skills or I can bring a different perspective. If I can't find information, that's a good reason to write it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Write tips that other people can also cover:</b> The world doesn't really need another "how to find the time to blog" tutorial. If I can filter through search results for a good one and make it more findable, that beats writing one from scratch&#x2013;unless I can add something special or relate different types of advice to each other.
</p>

<p>
<b>Review recent posts (weekly, monthly):</b> These are low-value in the short term (mostly lists of links, plus the nudge to do my weekly planning process), but I've found them to be surprisingly useful over the years. They also help keep my large blog archive manageable. That's why I keep posting them. I've started using the weekly and monthly reviews to give people <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/how-i-use-feedburner-to-give-people-the-option-of-different-blog-update-frequencies/">less-frequent subscription options</a> (daily can be a little overwhelming), so that's helpful too.

<p>
"Get better" is a vague goal. If you can identify the specific goals you would like to work toward, different ways to move towards those goals, and specific actions you can take to improve those approaches, you'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of growing. You'll find it easier to recognize or create opportunities to grow, and you can track your progress along the way. You might also be able to identify counter-productive approaches and replace them with ones that move towards more of your goals. Good luck and have fun!

<p>
The advice these days is to include a large image in your blog post,
somewhere “above the fold”, so that it can attract attention, visually
break up the page, and make your blog post more interesting.
</p>

<p>
I’m still trying to get the hang of how this might work. Other blogs
do this pretty well – Lifehacker, for example. More often, though,
stock photos look fake. Too posed. Too perfect. I could never quite
get the hang of

<p>
It took me a couple of hours, but I finally cleared the 700+ items
that had piled up in my Evernote inbox. Every so often, I go on a
tagging and filing spree. I was thinking about this because Timothy
Kenny told me how he has a virtual assistant file the notes in his
Microsoft OneNote notebooks.
</p>

<p>
Is my filing really worth it? Is it something I value enough to pay
someone else to do? Could I explain what I wanted clearly enough so
that other people could do it? Could I benefit from organization even
if I'm not the one organizing things myself?
</p>

<p>
Before I dig into that, I should probably examine this question: <b>What
do I use Evernote for, and what could "better" look like?</b>
</p>

<p>
Here's a quick summary of the different reasons I use Evernote:

<p>
I have different types of clipping activities:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A. Researching a topic</b>, which results in lots of clips related to a
single topic. Usually in preparation for a blog post or as a way to
answer a question.
</li>
<li><b>B. Casual browsing and clipping</b> based on blog posts, news items, or
other things I come across; roughly topical (ex: skill
development), although may be tagged and filed in different places
</li>
<li><b>C. Saving reference material from email or websites</b>, which should be filed
</li>
<li><b>D. Adding notes on the go using my phone</b>, which should be reviewed
and acted on or filed when I get back to my computer
</li>
<li><b>E. Automatically clipping things based on external input</b>, using
services like IFTTT to archive my blog posts.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are several strategies I could use to manage my Evernote
collection. I can choose different strategies based on the results
that I want. Here are some possibilities:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A. Spend a few extra seconds tagging and filing things when I clip
them.</b> Advantage: I touch something once, so I don't have to recall
the context of an item.
</li>
<li><b>B. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file shortly after
clipping.</b> Advantages: I can select multiple entries and tag them
give them the same tags, and copy all the note links in one go.
</li>
<li><b>C. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file weekly.</b> This is my
current strategy. This isn't working out too well - things pile up.
</li>
<li><b>D. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then teach someone to file.</b>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think strategy B will give me a good improvement in performance
without me needing to bring in someone else.
</p>

<p>
One of the areas that I could generally improve in is integrating the
notes into my outlines and plans. Instead of just collecting the
information, maybe I can use Copy Note Link and then spend some time
adding those links to my outline. Alternatively, I can copy the
source URL right then and there, find where it fits into my outline,
and paste the link. If org2blog respects comments, I could even use
that as part of my workflow.
</p>

<p>
So if I were to outsource more tasks in order to improve my
effectiveness at learning, I think I'd gain more value from finding
someone who can speed-read like I do, filtering through lots of cruft
on the Internet to find high-quality resources. They could then clip
those pages into Evernote for my review. That might be worth an
experiment or two&#x2026; Let's find out how that works!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-150">

"<b>Your blog is so eclectic</b>," said someone recently. In one week, I can
write about deep geekery, business, blogging, drawing, decision
making, and cooking. I deliberately shuffle my posts around so that
you get a variety of topics each week. (When I didn't do this kind of
planning, you sometimes got long stretches of geeky posts that went
over everyone else's heads&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
<b>My blog has a lot of different topics because I have a lot of
different interests.</b> The only challenge with <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/12/the-value-of-a-bottleneck/">posting daily</a> is making
myself stick to it instead of publishing two or three posts because I
get carried away. There's always so much to learn and share, and if I
don't write about it, I tend to forget it.
</p>

<p>
<b>I think it's time to experiment with different ways to write.</b> The
variety is fine for other people with wide-ranging interests. The
frequency is a little overwhelming, so I've started directing people
to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/weekly">weekly</a> and <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/monthly">monthly</a> updates.
</p>

<p>
<b>Please help me plan a new blog that's more focused on a set of
topics.</b> =) One that's updated weekly, so it's more manageable in
terms of reading. One that's written for readers first, instead of
being mostly personal notes that might be useful for other people. I'm
still going to update my personal blog (sachachua.com) with all these
notes, but once a week, I want to post a focused, well-written,
illustrated, "I spent 4-10 hours making something useful for you" post
that saves you time or money.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to focus on general-interest topics so that I can write
posts that might be useful for years and years to come. Tech-related
posts can be difficult to keep current - people come across Emacs blog
posts from 2008, and it can be hard to figure out what needs to be
changed. General topics tend to be longer-lasting.
</p>

<p>
Here is where I need your help and feedback: <b>What do you want to read
about?</b> There's a poll in this blog post. If you don't see it, please
check it out at TODO. If you give me your e-mail address (optional), I
can invite you to check out the blog when it starts out. =) (Sneak
previews!)
</p>


<p>
I'll probably branch it out under the "LivingAnAwesomeLife.com" domain
name - maybe in a subdirectory for ease of expansion later on?
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sketching a 1-hour talk generally takes 2-4 hours, including time to get there and a schedule that usually includes networking.

Shorter talks tend to be lighter-weight unless they've been rigorously planned and rehearsed.

<li>RSS is mostly dead. Only geeky people use it. <i>outline</i>
</li>
<li>Automatic e-mail newsletters

<li>I want to sell things only if they save you a lot of time
</li>
<li>Forget that. I want to give away so much that you almost feel
obliged to help.

<h4 id="unnumbered-161">Thoughts on growing an audience</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-161">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes I wonder if I should do more of the "Right Things" when
it comes to building a blog.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Focus on one or two topics so that people will subscribe because
you're consistent and reliable.
</li>
<li>Research keywords so that you can optimize for search engines
queries and write content that will bring people in.
</li>
<li>Reach out to new audiences with guest posts.
</li>
<li>Send e-mail newsletters so that you can build relationships and
so that you can sell to people later on.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can save other people time
</li>
<li>Can learn from more people
</li>
<li>Scale up - create more value for each unit of time I invest
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes I'm envious of blogs with hundreds of comments. On sites
like that, people learn a lot from each other, not just me. But I
remember that reading and responding to comments takes time, and I'd
want to filter through them for spam, and that other people glaze
over when they see pages and pages of comments and end up not
reading them. It's okay. I like the in-depth conversations we have
in comments. I'm not entirely sure if I'm sour-graping, but it seems
to make sense.
</li>
<li>Sometimes I wonder if this should be more like other blogs. But then
that's a well-travelled path, with lots of other people exploring
it. I have this amazing opportunity to try something different. I
should.
</li>
<li>Actually, I already know what I should do&#x2013;what works for me, what
I should do more.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The enduring posts on my blog are either tech notes (Emacs,
Drupal) or sketches.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The clearer my "no", the less I'm distracted from the things that I
can do.
</li>
<li>Like the way I hack around my introversion
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write about whatever I'm learning about - variety of interests, and
let more focused people use search results and category links
</li>
<li>Look at other people's questions and failed search results to
nudge me to write about certain topics if I'm curious about them
too
</li>
<li>Read good blogs and write about what inspires me, linking.
Invite people who don't have blogs to share their tips and
lessons learned on mine.
</li>
<li>Build relationships through comments. Give away as much as I
can of what I know. Let people show their appreciation if they
want to. Money is nice, but there are other ways too.
</li>

<li>Risks in getting too big

When you sell (and we're always selling), do you talk about what you
do and how you do it? Or do you start with <i>why</i> you do the things you
do and why this matters? In <i>Start With Why</i> (2009), Simon Sinek
writes about how great companies have a clear purpose and identity
that inspires employees and earns customer loyalty. Here's my sketch
of the key points from the book.

What are my whys?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Visual thinking
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My selfish reason for visual thinking is because I want to be able
to learn, think, and remember more effectively, so that I can live
a better life.
</li>
<li>My altruistic reason for sharing visual thinking is because there
are lots of people who enjoy learning from drawings more than text
or audio or video. I want to share how I'm learning, but more than
that, I want to inspire people to take these techniques and use
them for their own. From the resources I share, people can see
that you don't need to draw particularly well in order to use
doodling as a way to explore the world or untangle your thoughts.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Emacs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My selfish reason for Emacs is because I have fun tweaking my
editing environment and doing so helps me work better. It tickles
my brain. In addition, helping the Emacs community thrive
contributes to the longevity of Emacs, which means it will keep
growing, which means I probably won't have to switch to some other
tool in the future. (Planning-ahead Sacha plans ahead!)
</li>
<li>My altruistic reason for Emacs is because I think something
incredible happens when you take control of your tools, shaping
them to fit your needs, expanding your imagination along the way.
I want to help people become intermediate users and power users
because I'm curious about what they'll build for themselves and
what they can share with other people. Also, the Emacs community
has awesome people. =)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experimenting
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My selfish reason for experimenting (lifestyle, semi-retirement,
business, ideas, etc.) is so that I can figure out what works well
for me.
</li>
<li>My altruistic reason for sharing my experiments is to encourage
other people to question their assumptions, look for ways to test
their hypotheses, and gradually shape a life that fits them well.
Come to think of it, it's similar to why I like helping people
personalize Emacs. If I can help people explore the possibilities
in their life, we might come across interesting ideas along the
way.

I'm drafting this blog post on January 16, even though I'll publish it much later. I can't wait until I get through my backlog of posts I want to publish. I want to think about how I can make the most of this new index card habit, and whether I should reconsider that <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/02/decision-review-limiting-my-blog-to-one-post-a-day/">voluntary bottleneck of publishing one post a day</a>.
</p>

<p>
For the past two weeks, I've drawn at least five index cards each day.
Each card explores a single thought. I like the way this lets me
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27754&shareadraft=baba27754_54aad8179388e">briefly capture what I'm curious about</a>. I've included many of them in
blog posts, grouping several thoughts into a larger chunk that's
easier to link to.
</p>

<p>
Still, at the present rate, my monthly review for January will link to
well over 150 sketches. Perhaps I'll change the monthly review section
to list only the sketches that haven't made it into blog posts yet.
I've been keeping a digital equivalent of the roughly-sorted piles of
index cards on my desk. It helps me see growing clusters of ideas and
choose ones I want to develop with additional sketches or summarize
into blog posts.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15673515563/">2015-01-14 Projecting my writing trajectory &#x2013; index card #writing</a>
</p>

<p>
Also, at the present rate of writing 1-3 blog posts a day (except for
Thursdays, when I focus on consulting, and the weekends, when I focus
on household life), I will keep accumulating scheduled posts. At some
point, this will become unwieldy. It doesn't make sense to schedule
posts a year in advance. Even a backlog of three months seems too
disconnected.
</p>

<p>
I can spend less time writing, but I've firmly wired it into the way I
learn, so that's hard. Alternatively, I could spend <span class="underline">more</span> time
writing, developing thoughts over more time and packing denser
experiences into a post. This approach might work.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16293386465/">2015-01-14 Projecting my trajectory &#x2013; index card #writing #sharing #pipeline</a>
</p>

<p>
I can also get ideas out in other ways. My blog is the main archive I
trust, but I can give myself permission to share one-off sketches on
Twitter. For example, this sketch about <a href="https://twitter.com/sachac/status/555415373713903616">keeping your drink safe from
cats</a>: it's not quite a blog post and I don't think I'll develop the
thought further, but it might be okay to share it on its own.
</p>

<p>
So, if I write blog posts for the thoughts that are already developed
and tweets for the one-offs that won't be developed further, that
leaves the ideas that are waiting to be developed. They wait because
I'm still figuring things out, or because they aren't quite connected
to other thoughts, or because my attention has moved on to other
things. In Toyota Production System terms, they are <i>muda</i> - waste
because of waiting or possible over-production.
</p>

<p>
I want to do better. What are some ways I can improve at this?
</p>

<p>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15651715144/">2015.01.13 How can I do morning index cards more effectively &#x2013; index card #drawing</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>One way to reduce waste is to reduce quantity.</b> Is five a good number
for index cards, or should I reduce it to three? I think five works
well for me. It forces me to dig deeper into a topic or to capture
some of the other thoughts I have floating around.
</p>

<p>
<b>Another way to reduce the waste in this process is to be more focused.</b>
If I think about and articulating 2-3 key questions for the week, that
might guide most of my index cards. But then interesting ideas come up
during the week, and I draw lots of cards for those as well. I turn
many of my index cards into blog posts on the same day, so within each
day, there's focus. If I try to use any "extra" index cards to build
on a previously-drawn thought, that helps me connect.
</p>

<p>
<b>A third way is to reduce my attachment and let things go.</b> Perhaps I
might decide that after I make a monthly index of unblogged cards,
I'll clear that index and archive the physical cards. That way, each
month starts fresh, but I still have the ability to go back and look
for those roughly-categorized cards in case I have an idea that's
strongly connected to that. I don't have to worry about visualizing
this archive, tracking my statistics, using all the dangling threads,
or getting to 100% use.
</p>

<p>
So that can help me deal with index cards, but what about blog posts?
The benefits of limiting my blog to one post a day are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I occasionally add to or revise a scheduled post, especially with feedback from sharing drafts
</li>
<li>I can schedule different kinds of posts for a week, turning my sprint-type learning into a variety that helps readers
</li>
<li>People don't get as overwhelmed (although daily posts are already more frequent than most other blogs do, and I'm pleasantly boggled that this is the most frequent option chosen by people subscribing to the mailing list)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The downsides are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If I write something useful, whoever searches for it while it's in hidden draft mode won't come across it, but I guess that's almost the same as if I hadn't written it at all
</li>
<li>It delays the feedback cycle
</li>
<li>Sometimes posts get out of date
</li>
</ul>

<p>
One option is to go back to publishing on Sundays. Maybe another
thinking-out-loud/reflection post, since that's the one that has the
most surplus.
</p>

<p>
Another option is to post two times a day. I'm a little less keen on
that, although it might be doable if I can keep my main archive but
split off specific, lower-traffic, topic-focused views that people can
subscribe to.
</p>

<p>
A third option is to write longer posts. I find my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16106023660">constraints on chunk size</a> to be helpful, so maybe not.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. Maybe I'll publish on Sundays and then revisit this when I find
myself scheduling three months out&#x2026; =)

When people are starting out with sketchnoting, it's helpful to
remember that sketchnoting's about "ideas, not art" (as Mike Rohde
says in <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/12/visual-book-review-the-sketchnote-handbook-mike-rohde/">The Sketchnote Handbook</a>). It's easy to get intimidated by the
visually-impressive sketchnotes people post, so the reminder is
useful.
</p>

<p>
I've been using sketchnotes to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/12/year-drawing-own-content/">explore my own thoughts</a> instead of
recording other people's content. I like flipping things around, so
that got me thinking: <b>What can I learn from the way artists work, and
how can I apply that to learning and drawing?</b>
</p>

<p>
Here are a few ideas:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16021004097/">2015.01.05 What can I learn from artists about learning &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Collect:</b> Artists collect inspiration. They fill sketchbooks, make
moodboards, clip reference photos, and so on.
</li>
<li><b>Emulate:</b> Artists develop their skills by emulating masters.
</li>
<li><b>Observe:</b> Artists draw what's there, not what they think is there. They also analyze the techniques other artists use and the effect of these techniques on the piece.
</li>
<li><b>Imagine:</b> Artists aren't limited to what they see. They can draw what <span class="underline">isn't</span> there. They can draw the essence of a thing.
</li>
<li><b>Transform:</b> Great art transforms the way people see.
</li>
<li><b>Experiment:</b> Artists try different techniques and styles to figure out what works for them.
</li>
<li><b>Craft:</b> Artists refine their work and improve their tools.
</li>
<li><b>Sketch:</b> Artists do quick studies to try several views or focus on different aspects before making the commitment of paint on canvas.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I was particularly curious about this idea of making studies or
sketching things in order to experiment with different views or to
focus on small parts before composing the whole, so I dug into that
further.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16180954816/">2015.01.05 Why studies for drawing or writing thoughts &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
The limits I want to address are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When I start with a large sheet, I sometimes peter out halfway
through because I've dug to the bottom of that idea (at least for
now, with the tools and time I have).
</li>
<li>If I work with large sheets, it's not as easy to keep all the
relevant ones in view at the same time. I need to summarize more
frequently.
</li>
<li>I often zig-zag between topics, leaving sheets unfinished.
Half-sheets are awkward to post.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16019468000/">2015.01.05 Quick idea studies &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
Using index cards for "studies" of an idea might be a useful
technique. Each card is a small chunk, quick to capture, complete in
itself, and yet linkable with others. The cards are easier to
rearrange. If each card represents one idea or summary, I can keep
more ideas in view.
</p>

<p>
There are trade-offs, naturally. Sometimes the desire to fill a large
sheet makes me to sit with a question longer, letting me discover
more. Large sheets gives me the ability to draw and describe
relationships between ideas. If I have many small chunks, I need to
invest more time in summarizing and filing in order to make the most
of them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16206001482/">2015.01.05 Managing my idea pipeline &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
Artists might make studies in preparation for a specific work, or they
might make studies just because. If I have a specific question in
mind, it's easy to sketch my way around the topic and then organize
those thoughts into a whole. I'm not as good at managing fragments
over an extended period of time, although I'm getting better at
linking to and building on previous blog posts.
</p>

<p>
What can I learn from the way artists keep working on something?
Artists might work on a piece for weeks or more, keeping it visible on
an easel, taking a step back from time to time, looking at it in
different light. They might have several such pieces on the go. I
still prefer publishing early instead of waiting until something is a
masterpiece. Feedback is great, and even small chunks can be
surprisingly useful.
</p>

<p>
If I improve the way I manage my studies, though, I might get better
at refining ideas. I think it's like the way an artists might clip
photos or sketch things that have caught their eyes, and then return
to that inspiration years later when they think of something that
needs it.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of archives: I've written about index cards before as a way
to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/09/index-cards/">develop thoughts</a> (2014; much like this post), <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2007/05/charting-my-life-on-index-cards-saturday-afternoon-goal-setting-workshop/">plan my life</a> (2007),
and <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2005/04/index-cards-for-today-boredom-prevention-device-contingency-plans-hipster-pda-taxi/">prevent boredom by writing</a> (2005!). I haven't quite mastered this
yet, but I'm getting somewhere. What can I add to this based on this
reflection on artists?
</p>

<p>
I don't do enough zoomed-in focus or variations on a theme yet, I
think. Studies aren't just about capturing the gist of a thing so that
you can reproduce it later in your studio. They let you minutely
observe a specific aspect, and they let you experiment with different
ways to portray something.
</p>

<p>
What would that look like, if I could do it really well? For
observation, I might have index cards that focus on <b>sub-topics</b>, like the way I've built up this post from the
sub-questions in the illustrations. For variety, I might experiment
with <b>visual vocabulary and metaphors</b>, improving my creative
expression.
</p>

<p>
There's also something to be said about <b>sheer practice</b> in exploring
thoughts, like the way artists might sketch for sketching's sake.
James Altucher recommends coming up with <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/">ten ideas a day</a> (also
related: <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/10/how-to-become-an-idea-machine/">his post from 2012</a>). I've been experimenting with setting
myself a minimum of five index cards a day. I write the dates for all
of them before I start on the first one so that the desire to fill in
the blanks pushes me to complete all of them. This usually leads to
even more cards as the first set of ideas sparks more questions.
</p>

<p>
Actually, the challenge isn't generating ideas. Artists never run out
of things to sketch - they can look around and find more! I have an
archive of ideas I haven't exhausted and a cornucopia that generates
more every day.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16020717209/">2015.01.05 Thinking about my archive &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
This leads me back to skills that I think might be good to borrow from
the art world and adapt to what I want:

<li><b>Observing what's in front of me</b> - really seeing it, capturing it
better, evoking its essence
</li>
<li><b>Looking at something from different angles</b>, and developing opinions
about the alternatives I can pick - like the way artists learn about
composition and light
</li>
<li><b>Retrieving subsets of my archive</b> - like the way artists might pull
out the relevant studies or reference photos when they're working on
a piece
</li>
<li><b>Comprehending the whole</b> - the way people can step back and talk
about impressionism, Picasso's Blue Period, and other things that
require zooming out
</li>
</ul>

<p>
What would masters of this be like, and how can I emulate them? I
think of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1920&bih=1085&q=leonardo+da+vinci+studies&oq=leonardo+da+vinci+studies&gs_l=img.3..0l2.1662.4950.0.5169.28.14.1.6.6.0.195.1544.2j9.11.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..10.18.1640.U0gilXXy2GQ">Leonardo da Vinci's studies</a>, asking and observing. I think of
writers who name and describe things, and in so doing, they help me
see better - the way the light behind an object separates it from the
background. I may never draw or write a thousandth as well as they do,
but I can grow through emulating the way they slow down and pay
attention, the way they turn things over and over instead of rushing
on.

In 2013, I decided to focus on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/12/year-drawing-own-content/">drawing my own content instead of
sketchnoting other people's talks</a>. I drew 379 sketches exploring my
questions, and I wove those into my blog posts so that I could think
in bigger chunks.

In 2014, I continued this habit.

I've been thinking a lot about goals lately, thanks to a few
discussions with friends. I don't feel particularly driven by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">big,
hairy, audacious goals (BHAGs)</a>. Instead, I focus on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/12/one-to-three-thats-all/">small wins</a> and
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/03/reflecting-goals-time/">low-hanging fruit</a>, <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/choosing-impact-motivation-vs-understanding/">accumulating progress</a>. I don't have a clear picture
of exactly where I'd like to be in 40 years. Instead, I have a
multiplicity of posibilities.
</p>

<p>
But maybe I'm <b>not</b> a special snowflake, and I can learn from the
kinds of goals many people have. It's fun to put on a different hat
and try things out. By trying on common goals instead of rejecting them off-hand, maybe I'll figure out more about what I really want and how to get there.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16149406658/">2015-01-21 What if I tried on common goals &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
Aristotle says that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_happiness">happiness</a> is the ultimate goal.
</p>

<p>
<img src="file:~/Dropbox/Inbox/To blog/2015-01-21 Playing with popular goals - Happiness -- index card #popular-goals.png" alt="2015-01-21 Playing with popular goals - Happiness -- index card #popular-goals.png" />
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15717070063/">2015-01-21 Playing with popular goals - Happiness &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
I find it helpful to think of happiness as a response to life instead
of as an external state to pursue, so this goal feels a little odd to
me. But it's interesting to imagine a happy 90-year-old Sacha and what
that life would be like. I think it involves building specific
warm-and-fuzzy memories, maintaining a good perspective, and
minimizing stressors.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at other typical goals: wealth, power, fame, and
knowledge/experiences.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15717070433/">2015-01-21 Popular goals - Wealth &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
This might be the easiest of goals to desire, since it's popular and
measurable. Based on my reading, I imagine that conspicuous wealth
will bring more problems than I'd like, so I don't aspire to
high-flying lifestyles. I value freedom, so it makes sense to have a
financial buffer and to avoid becoming too accustomed to luxuries.
That increases my security, which allows me to do more experiments.
(I'm already privileged as it is!) Tools can be good investments, and
it's great to be able to strategically use money to make a bigger
difference. Money also makes decisions easier: instead of worrying
about cutting into your safety margin, you can try things out and see
what happens.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16336117852/">2015-01-21 Popular goals - Power &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
Power includes determining your life and influencing other people's
lives. I definitely care about having power over myself, but I'm not
driven by the idea of making big decisions that affect thousands of
people's lives.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16311048086/">2015-01-21 Popular goals - Fame &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
I think I care more about depth of connection (tribe) than about
breadth of fame (celebrity). I'm not sure about legacy. On one hand,
it's good to do things that are remarkable enough to help or inspire
people throughout the years. On the other hand, what do we do that
will matter after a century, and how can we get things to even be
remembered for that long? I'll think about this a little more while
reading history. What makes essays resonate with me even after all
that time, and how can I also reach across the years?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15717070243/">2015-01-21 Popular goals - Knowledge or experience &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
I like the goal of learning more so that I can appreciate life better,
maintain my independence, contribute meaningfully, and make better
decisions.
</p>

<p>
I focus more on knowledge in the sketch above, but I think the popular approach to this goal is to focus on experiences. Bucket lists are practically all about experiences: seeing this country, climbing that mountain. That's why travel is so big, I guess. What kinds of experiences would I like to have if I were to travel more?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16346641106/">2015-01-24 Thinking about collecting experiences &#x2013; index card #goals #experiences</a>
</p>

<p>
I currently don't like traveling, but it'll probably be less of a hassle once I get my Canadian passport sorted out.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16169936017/">2015-01-23 What would help me enjoy travel &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
Still, with J- in school and three cats at home, it's hard to plan.
Maybe this will be something for later.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16185230850/">2015-01-25 On the other hand - travel &#x2013; index card #travel #learning #cooking</a>
</p>

<p>
Besides, I'm not totally convinced that travel is the best way to learn these things. It was fun being immersed in a language and going to local shops. But traveling to learn more about cooking seems a little wasteful, since airfare alone will buy lots of ingredients (and even personalized cooking classes). Staying home means I focus on cooking dishes I can enjoy long-term, and I can take advantage of our kitchen setup. So there's an advantage to staying home, too.
</p>

<p>
What about other intrinsic goals?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16149616830/">2015-01-21 Popular goals - Health &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
Health makes sense, since your enjoyment of many things can be curtailed by poor health. I probably won't strive for buffed-up awesomeness, though. I'm mostly focusing on functioning all right, with maybe a little effort here and there to do a bit better.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16336987555/">2015-01-21 Popular goals - Meaning &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
People want to make a difference at work and in their relationships.
Many people feel that their work doesn't matter a lot. Despite the
abstraction of my work (I move bits around? I crunch numbers and
questions? I write tools for a tiny, tiny fraction of the world?), I'm
pretty good at convincing myself I have a small impact. =) Do I want to trade up by focusing on work that has a bigger impact (either for more people, or deeper in people's lives? I don't know yet.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16149406828/">2015-01-21 Popular goals - Tranquility, equanimity &#x2013; index card #popular-goals</a>
</p>

<p>
I like this goal the most. Stoicism tells me that it's the one thing under my control. It transforms the ups and downs of life into opportunities for growth. It doesn't mean that I can't enjoy things, I just shouldn't get so attached to them that I become afraid. It doesn't mean that I can't be sad, it means I can try to take a different perspective on things.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. Trying on popular goals helped me take advantage of the
collective centuries (millennia?) of thought that have gone into those
goals. I still have to come up with my own specifics, but it's good to
be able to quickly test what resonates with me instead of trying to
formulate everything by myself. If tranquility, happiness, and
knowledge are my major goals (with health as the goal I know I should
have), I can focus on coming up with specific ways I want to explore
those areas.
</p>

<p>
Do you resonate with some common goals? What are they, and what are you learning from that?

Draw this
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Take notes
</li>
<li>Why
</li>

<li>Take hand-written notes
</li>

<li>Slow down and write legibly
You don't have to write everything
Leave yourself space, then come back and fill things in later
A good ink helps: find one that's readable and doesn't smear
Tip: stash pens everywhere so that you're never without one!
</li>

<li>Emphasize important concepts
Boxes, highlighter, color pencils, etc
(Test the highlighter - sometimes ink can get messed up!)
</li>

<li><p>
Use simple shapes.
Star - important point
Box, check - TODO
Arrow - next step
Speech bubble - quote
Thought cloud - what you were thinking
Lightbulb - idea
</p>

<p>
Make rough copies of diagrams
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
Have fun by drawing faces. This is a surprisingly good way to
remember an event, and it's also a good way to settle in if you're
early. (Being early is great for grabbing good seats.)
</p>

<p>
Write down the topic title and the speaker name, then spend a few
minutes sketching the person's face. You can start with a simple
rectangle with roughly the right proportions. Hair style? Glasses
or eyes? Nose? Facial hair? Smile? Doesn't have to be perfect.
</p>
</li>

<li>Draw other icons. People often repeat themselves or say things you
don't have to write down, so you can doodle during those parts.
Draw simple images related to what people are talking about. (Or
draw things that are completely unrelated - up to you!) Listen for
visual metaphors and try to draw them. Leave yourself space, and
then come back and doodle when you have time.
</li>
</ol>

Whenever I sketchnote an event, people tell me that they love my work. They ask if I'd be interested in sketching other events, podcasts, books, presentation designs, blog post illustrations, and so on. People love the informal, informative style of sketchnotes, and they want to use it to spread more ideas. Terrific!
</p>

<p>
<b>But you know what would be even awesomer? It would be fantastic if <i>more</i> people could get into sketchnoting - pro-bono, for barter, or professionally.</b> There are a lot of great ideas out there that are missing their potential because they get forgotten or people's eyes glaze over when confronted by lots of text or slides. More sketchnoters, more possibilities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Many sketchnoters and graphic recorders refer work to people they know when they're too busy themselves.</b> I want to refer as much as possible to other people, especially people I don't know. I want to broaden the network and bring more people in. I want my default to be referring work to other people, accepting work myself only if it's something I really care about and I'm the only one who can make it happen. (Which is probably never, because lots of people can draw!)
</p>

<p>
<b>It makes sense to have lots of sketchnoters sharing the opportunities instead of a few sketchnoters drawing most of the work.</b> When a topic lines up with your interests or background, everything is better. You have a richer visual vocabulary. You learn a lot more from the content. You can keep up with speakers more easily. And when there are lots of active sketchnoters, we can learn a lot from each other's styles.
</p>

<p>
<b>I think it would be interesting to have a gig board</b> where people can post opportunities and other people can contact them if interested. This is different from a job board because jobs tend to be longer-term commitments, while sketchnoting might just be a few hours. I don't mind routing everything through my e-mail first.
</p>

<p>
So, what's getting in people's way now, and how can we address that?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>A slowly growing market</b>: Although some event organizers have been taking advantage of graphical summaries as a way of reaching out to attendees and prospects, graphic recording is still pretty limited in terms of conferences and corporate events. Sketchnoting is still pretty novel.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to focus on event organizers who don't know about sketchnoting yet. It's helpful to have a place where organizers who want sketchnotes can connect with sketchnoters.
</p>

<p>
Many events have limited budgets, especially in this economy, so they might not be able to afford professional sketchnoting. However, if a pro-bono or barter event matches up with a sketchnoter's interests, maybe the sketchnoter will do it anyway. Besides, I want to encourage organizers to think of more creative bartering opportunities: links? sponsorship? feedback over lunches? ticket giveaways? introductions? testimonials?
</p>

<p>
How is this different from, say, simply showing up at an event and taking notes? Connecting with the organizers beforehand makes it easier for the organizers and the sketchnoters to make the most of the sketches. The organizers might be able to arrange complimentary tickets, perhaps including an extra ticket that the sketchnoter can raffle off or trade with someone else. The organizer can help publicize the sketchnotes, and the sketchnoters can get a wider audience.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>The power law:</b> Sketchnoters who post their notes publicly get lots of requests, which lead to more sketches, which lead to more requests. There are even more sketchnoters who haven't made that jump. Maybe they're not comfortable posting their work online or their website isn't popular, but they'd be fine with e-mailing an organizer samples of their work.
</li>

<li><p>
<b>Sketchnoters might be too intimidated to make the leap.</b> I remember being nervous the first time I committed to sketchnoting an event for a fee. What if things fell through? What if I wasn't good enough? It turns out that an excellent way to deal with risk is to offer a guarantee, which is good for the client <i>and</i> good for you. As for worrying I wasn't good enough&#x2013;I figured the client was grown-up enough to make decisions based on my online portfolio. If they thought my stick figures were awesome, then okay!
</p>

<p>
I can help sketchnoters get over their intimidation by talking through their concerns and helping them mitigate them. For example, I sometimes worry about my tools failing on me, so I bring backups. There are lots of things you can plan for or around.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you're intimidated, you might pair up with another sketchnoter, especially at a pro-bono event. Connecting with the organizer and the other sketchnoter(s) beforehand will make it easier to, say, sit together with the other person or swap URLs afterwards.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have a couple of requests that I'd like to refer to other people. What would be a good way of sharing them?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A. <b>Post them on my regular blog in a new category</b>, coordinating with the people who want them posted. Tag with keywords. List open opportunities in the sidebar. Continue doing this until I start receiving requests from other people, then split it off into a separate blog.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advantage: No need to maintain a different site.
</li>
<li>Disadvantage: Blog clutter, and people may find it difficult to see just those posts.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B. <b>Create a new site.</b> Post the current requests there after coordinating with the people who want them posted, tagging with keywords. List open opportunities in the sidebar. Tweet announcements and link to them from my main blog; spread the word. Accept requests by e-mail or contact form. Eventually look into job board plugins if there's a lot of interest. It should also have a newsletter that people can sign up for. Eventually this might even have people's profiles.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advantage: Uncluttered. Can customize display.
</li>
<li>Disadvantage: May go stale. Probably a good idea to create it on
one of my domains first (maybe somewhere under Sketchnote
Index?). Need to maintain another site.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I like option B more. So let's run it as a little experiment&#x2026; Here are some possible outcomes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Okay:</b> If I post my current requests there and I don't find anyone,
well, at least I have a place to post future requests, and I can say I've tried.
</li>
<li><b>Good:</b> If I match people to my current requests and have a handy place for me to refer future requests, that's fine even if I don't get external requests.
</li>
<li><b>Better:</b> If other people subscribe to it and are interested in hearing about opportunities, that's a double-win.
</li>
<li><b>Best:</b> If people start submitting requests and it gets to the point where it makes sense to build a job post submission interface or a geolocated search, that's a triple win.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm not going to invest a lot of time into it in the beginning, so I might start with a simple theme and no development work. As we see the response, I can make it better.
</p>

<p>
Sounds like a plan! Any thoughts or suggestions?

I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.
</p>

<p>
Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a
</p>

<p>
I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.
</p>

<p>
Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder&#x2026;

How to listen and draw at the same time
</p>


<p>
When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!

Here's an excerpt from Seneca's <i>Epistles</i> (Letter 18) that made me
think about voluntary simplicity:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Such is the course which those men I have followed who, in their
imitation of poverty, have every month come almost to want, that they
might never recoil from what they had so often rehearsed.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; Even Epicurus, the teacher of pleasure, used to observe stated
intervals, during which he satisfied his hunger in niggardly fashion;
he wished to see whether he thereby fell short of full and complete
happiness, and, if so, by what amount be fell short, and whether this
amount was worth purchasing at the price of great effort.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; For though water, barley-meal, and crusts of barley-bread, are not
a cheerful diet, yet it is the highest kind of Pleasure to be able to
derive pleasure from this sort of food, and to have reduced one's
needs to that modicum which no unfairness of Fortune can snatch away.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm careful with my finances because I don't want to end up in the
kinds of situations that I see play out around me and on the Internet.
I know I can't eliminate those risks (no one is immune to bad luck!),
but I can try to minimize the risks.
</p>

<p>
I'm pretty insulated from everyday troubles. I'm not often hungry or
thirsty. I usually bring a bottle of water and a snack in my bag, and
in the city, there are always places to go. We have what we need and
want, and we don't worry about where our next meal is coming from or
how we can keep a roof over our heads.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when I talk to people a little further ahead in life, I'm
reminded that prosperity can lead to complacency. Some people tell me
they wish they could do something like this experiment of mine with
semi-retirement, but on the other hand, they like their current
lifestyle a lot too. I like keeping my life simple and my budget
almost student-ish. I check out thrift stores for clothes. I shop for
groceries with a list, do the math when it comes to prices, and enjoy
home-cooked meals more than restaurant steaks. It's a way of
minimizing risks and increasing safety, I guess. If I don't get used
to the good life &#x2013; if I fight lifestyle inflation and hedonic
adaptation &#x2013; then I can more easily weather any downturns in markets
or luck.
</p>

<p>
How can I get even better at this? In terms of food, it's good to
practice with simple ingredients and simple techniques. Then the main
differentiator would be skill in choosing, combining, and cooking. I
can still enjoy the things that I'm not very skilled at. I might even
skip a meal, or eat lightly. In terms of transportation, maybe I
should walk long distances once in a while, so I don't get too
accustomed to taking transit or biking. In terms of things, I can give
more things away, or box things up temporarily.
</p>

<p>
It's good to get pleasure from the small stuff. I can drink tap water
here in Toronto, which still boggles me no end. I can read hundreds of
books from the library. I can walk and feel the sun shining. I can
breathe and feel my lungs inflate. What do I need richer pleasures
for, if these simple ones can be enough?

<p>
When I took the required philosophy courses in university, I was too
young for it. We all were; inarticulate adolescents with little life
experience. Perhaps a brilliant teacher would have been able to teach
it anyway, and perhaps for some of my classmates our teachers were
brilliant. I struggled with the courses, though. The topics seemed
abstract and impractical. We read Plato's <i>Republic</i> and were quizzed
on his ideal society. We read the <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i> and
differentiated among types of friendship. We read Hannah Arendt's
thoughts on totalitarianism and discussed terror. But nothing really
made an impact on my everyday life, aside from the unexpected oddness
of being comfortable with&#x2013;even enjoying&#x2013;the hopelessness and despair
described by Sartre when it seemed, based on how we were taught and
how my classmates responded, that I should have had more philosophical
discomfort with the concept.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hence the young man is not a fit student of Moral Philosophy, for he
has no experience in the actions of life, while all that is said
presupposes and is concerned with these: and in the next place, since
he is apt to follow the impulses of his passions, he will hear as
though he heard not, and to no profit, the end in view being practice
and not mere knowledge.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Aristotle, <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i> (Book 1 - 1095a)
</p>

<p>
The normal course of events, perhaps, might be that I'd revisit these
topics later in life. Much later, the way people conscious of
mortality tend to think about life. I think this 5-year experiment of
mine nudged me to think about the best use of time, and from there to
wonder about Aristotle's recommendation of the contemplative life.
Time and patience
</p>

<p>
I'm not quite at the point of understanding Heidegger and similar
thinkers. I don't need to get there, I think, in order to get some
benefit from applying philosophy to life. I want to train my mind to
see clearly, want the right things, not want the wrong things, act on
these right judgments, and be able to explain what I'm learning to
myself and to others. Starting this early makes sense, because then I
can avoid bad habits (or unlearn them before they get ingrained) and
enjoy the benefits for longer.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you
may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace
with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when
you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but
quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when
one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Seneca, <i>Epistles</i>, Letter 4
</p>

<p>
In a later letter, Seneca also tells us that we don't have to put this
kind of thinking off until we are comfortably settled. This reminds me
of how people set these constantly moving goalposts for themselves ("I
just need to make $XXX,000" - and then higher, and higher), and why it
made sense to me to risk jumping earlier rather than later. We'll see
how this works out.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and
living simply is voluntary poverty. Away, then, with all excuses like:
"I have not yet enough; when I have gained the desired amount, then I
shall devote myself wholly to philosophy." And yet this ideal, which
you are putting off and placing second to other interests, should be
secured first of all; you should begin with it. You retort: "I wish to
acquire something to live on." Yes, but learn while you are acquiring
it; for if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to
die nobly.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Seneca, <i>Epistles</i>, Letter 17
</p>

<p>
Now is a good time, I think. I can train my thinking and inspire my
writing with classic, clear texts, and I can work on learning things
that are common to more people than my other niche interests are.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-332">

</p>

<p>
In <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i>, Aristotle considers virtue as the ideal balance between two vices (one type of deficiency and one of excess). For example, courage is between cowardice and foolhardiness. This is the idea of the golden mean. Virtue is a little closer to one end than the other, so we should err on the side of the lesser evil. We also naturally skew to one side, so we should try to counteract our biases.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Therefore he who aims at the mean should make it his first care to keep away from that extreme which is more contrary than the other to the mean; just as Calypso in Homer advises Ulysses,
</p>

<p>
"Clear of this smoke and surge thy barque direct;"
</p>

<p>
because of the two extremes the one is always more, and the other less, erroneous; and, therefore, since to hit exactly on the mean is difficult, one must take the least of the evils as the safest plan; and this a man will be doing, if he follows this method.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(from D.P. Chase's translation)
</p>

<p>
and
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We ought also to take into consideration our own natural bias; which varies in each man's case, and will be ascertained from the pleasure and pain arising in us. Furthermore, we should force ourselves off in the contrary direction, because we shall find ourselves in the mean after we have removed ourselves far from the wrong side, exactly as men do in straightening bent timber.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(also D.P. Chase)
</p>

<p>
Of the ranges he describes, I think I lean towards:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>cowardice</b>, COURAGE, recklessness
</li>
<li><b>stinginess</b>, LIBERALITY, prodigality
</li>
<li><b>parsimony</b>, MAGNIFICENCE, vulgarity and crassness
</li>
<li><b>unirasciblility/slavishness</b>, GENTLENESS, irascibility
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These vices of mine are a set. Despite knowing that people tend to
regret inaction more than action and that in the grand scheme of
things, there is nothing to fear, I make decisions carefully and anticipate more pain than I should. Still, I'm pretty good at hope.
I prefer to save money so that I can maintain my freedom. I give a
little to charities and to people when it could make a big difference.
I tend to think that people usually benefit more from time and
attention more than money, so I rarely have clear decisions between
noble action and money. I'm definitely not good at using large sums for worthy work, and more habituated towards accounting for the small things.
I keep myself a little distant from the world, minimizing anger. There are many things that perhaps I should be angrier at, but I prefer to move on.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insensibility, MODERATION, licentiousness
</li>
<li>irony/understatement, PLAIN DEALING, boastfulness
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am generally good at not being pained by the absence of pleasures and not taking more pleasure in things than they're worth. Possibly I err on the side of insensibility, since I don't get as much pleasure from things that I probably should appreciate better. I also tend to be good at disclaiming my limitations instead of pretending to be better than I am.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>boorishness, WITTINESS, buffoonery
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I enjoy wordplay. Still, I don't recognize myself in Aristotle's
descriptions here. I guess it's just not developed enough to be a
virtue (even a virtue-in-training?) and not extreme enough to be a
vice.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>quarrelsomeness, FRIENDLINESS, <b>obsequity</b>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I skew towards finding things and people agreeable (or at least
letting them make their own decisions). I probably don't challenge
people enough, not the way a good friend would call you out if you're
doing things wrong.
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, how can I improve? It's pretty difficult to take
Aristotle's suggestion for counteract my biases by aiming for the
opposite vice. Examples of consequences are too easy to recall. The
Internet is full of stories of recklesness, prodigality, crassness,
irascibility, licentiousness, and buffoonery. No one enjoys
quarrelsomeness. Irony/understatement recedes into the background.
</p>

<p>
There are some other ways that have been working for me, though. Maybe
building on these approaches will help me do even better. Aristotle
says that you can develop virtue by practising virtuous acts, so maybe
there's hope for me yet. Here are some workarounds for my biases:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Towards courage, liberality, and magnificence - setting aside money and time beforehand:</b> Pre-allocating a small
portion of my savings for trying things out helps me reduce the
mental cost of choices. Setting aside a small charity budget (both
time and money) makes it easier to say, yes, this is something I can
help with. I don't have to limit myself to formal channels for
generosity, either. Even listening, cleaning, or cooking can be acts
of generosity, done with the right heart.
</li>
<li><b>Towards courage - Keeping learning in mind:</b> If I'm conservative about choices
because I don't want to mess up really badly, remembering that I can
learn even from messing up may help. Besides, I can practice on
choices with smaller consequences, and I can remember all those
times when making similar choices worked out okay.
</li>
<li><b>Approaching life with the question "How wonderful can it be?" </b>:
I'm reluctant to be too ambitious because I've seen so many stories
of people who get carried away by their passions, dealing with the
ups and downs of having a business or following their goals. I'm not
keen on having that kind of narrative. However, if I start with a
good foundation of happiness and then constantly expand by learning
more, doing more, and helping more, I think I can enfold larger and
larger things in my ambition without taking the other kind of greed
or desire into me.
</li>
<li><b>Learning about the little differences</b>: Knowledge sharpens
appreciation. A tiny example - I now have a preference for the
blueberries we grow (however scant the handful) over the blueberries
we buy at No Frills because I know that blueberries can be tastier
than what we get at the supermarket. This doesn't stop me from
appreciating blueberry muffins made with supermarket berries, but it
allows me to take greater pleasure when we do have berries at home.
Likewise, learning about the little distinctions can help me enjoy
other things better, and I can be careful about not turning into a
snob who can't enjoy simpler things.
</li>
<li><b>Focusing on the good</b>:
</li>

<li>humility, MODESTY, <b>pride</b>
</li>
<li>secrecy, HONESTY, <b>loquacity</b>
</li>
<li>moroseness, GOOD HUMOR, <b>absurdity</b>
</li>
<li>quarrelsomeness, FRIENDSHIP, <b>flattery</b>
</li>
</ul>

We've been trying

and we occasionally succeed, but more often than not, we end up going for a yummy home-cooked dinner instead.

Oh! Hence <b>handbook</b> - something small that you carry with you to
guide your actions or remember principles when the craziness of life
messes up your mind. This got me thinking about what might be the
beginnings of my handbook: the little ideas that run through my life.
Here are some.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Happiness is a response.</b> Happiness isn't something you buy or
pursue, nor is it something that happens to you or that someone
gives to you. This feeling of well-being comes from how you decide
to respond to the world.
</li>
<li><b>It's just stuff.</b> A common refrain when we're donating things to
the thrift store, passing up on purchases, cleaning up after
something breaks, and so on.
</li>
<li><b>Life is short.</b> Before, nothingness. After, nothingness. We know
people for such a short time. This is okay; in fact, it makes life sweeter.
</li>
<li><b>Life is long.</b> There's lots of things to learn, and you're going to
run into similar situations again and again. You don't need to sweat
over making the absolute best decisions, since you'll probably be
able to try out different options. Still, giving things a little
thought helps, because you can reap the benefits over time.
</li>
<li><b> "Enough" is in the mind.</b> You have enough.
</li>
<li><b>Celebrate small steps.</b> Because they're fun!
</li>
<li><b>Everything is part of the story.</b> Especially the tough parts. They
make the story interesting.
</li>
<li><b>Build on your strengths.</b> Situations can often be transformed into
similar situations that take advantage of your strengths instead of
hitting your weaknesses. Likewise, you can translate your strengths into new ones.
</li>
<li><b>See the third way.</b> When you think something is the only way, or
when you're stuck with the dilemma of one or another, step back and
see even more approaches. You don't have to accept the way the
problem is framed; look for creative solutions.
</li>
<li><b>Choose what to assent to.</b> Be careful about what you let into your
brain. For example, just because advertising is compelling doesn't
mean you have to be compelled.
</li>
<li><b>It's okay to be weird. Life is a grand experiment.</b> If you zig when
other people zag, you might feel weird, but don't worry - there are
lots of people zigging in the grand scheme of things, too.
</li>
<li><b>Everyone's learning.</b> Everyone messes up. Everyone has bad days.
Everyone has awesome moments. Practise loving kindness.
</li>
<li><b>Share.</b> Your memory is fuzzy and life is short. Get things out of
your head and in a form that might help other people, and you could
be pleasantly surprised by how it comes back.
</li>
<li><b>A safety net helps you fly.</b> It's worth weaving a strong net so
that you can take risks.
</li>
<li><b>Everything will be okay.</b> Things always work out, although
sometimes it takes some time, action, or perspective.
</li>
<li><b>Cats will be cats.</b> There is no point in getting upset over
out-of-the-litter-box thinking, throwing up, etc. Just tidy up and
enjoy the purring and the fluffy cat-ness. The same can be said of
much of life.
</li>
</ul>

Ask me again in five years and I'll probably have added a few more.
What's in your handbook?

<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/11/coming-up-with-a-three-word-life-philosophy/">"Learn, share, scale"</a> were the three words I picked in 2012 to
describe what I want to do. It's a useful framework for looking at my
different interests and figuring out how I can learn, what I can
share, and how I can scale up beyond the limits of 24 hours in a day
and only one life. By breaking things down into those components, I
can look for more effective approaches. By seeing them as a whole
cycle, I can try to move more through each stage instead of getting
stuck in one or the other.

I've been learning about philosophy over the past few weeks. I like
the way Thoreau frames it:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.

<p>
So I'm more interested in ethical philosophy rather than, say, phenomenology.
</p>



<p>
What would that look like in this framework of "learn, share, scale?"
</p>

<p>
<b>Learn</b>: I read a lot of books

<p>
<b>Share</b>: i

<p>
<b>Scale</b>: This one's a little harder to think about.

We've been watching episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HISHEdotcom">How It Should Have Ended</a> lately. One
of them led to Stan's Rants, so we watched Stan Lee rant about a few
things. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXl0g6LxGyc">His rant about birthdays</a> was particularly interesting for me
because of our reflections on Stoicism, negative visualization, and
the idea of <i>memento mori</i> - remembering your mortality.
</p>

<p>
W- and I don't celebrate the way it seems other people do. We're not
really into going to a bar with friends, having people over for a
party, or going to a fancy restaurant. We did end up going for dimsum
with his family yesterday, since his mom insisted, but otherwise we
would have probably stayed home.
</p>

<p>
I like treating these occasions as an opportunity to account for how I
used the previous year, reflect on (and celebrate!) the changes, and
think about how my priorities might shift for the upcoming year. Doing
this kind of annual review around this time makes more sense to me
than New Year's Day, since New Year's Day has all that noise around
holidays and resolutions. I used to do annual reviews a few times a
year, but I found myself covering the same ground and getting slightly
confused about the timespans. I do like checking in with myself on an
infrequent basis, though. You might not see day-to-day changes, but
when you look back over a longer period of time, you can appreciate
the distance you've covered.
</p>

<p>
Still, there's something to be said about celebrating milestones,
creating opportunities for shared experiences, and thanking people who
are part of my life. Perhaps I'll revisit it sometime, or find a
different way.
</p>

<p>
But I'll still wish my parents a happy birthday, since after all, my mom did all that hard work. =)

I reflect on mortality pretty frequently; at least every week, and
probably much more often than that. If you do it just a few times each
year, you'll hardly get used to it. I think it makes life sweeter,
knowing that life's so short.
</p>

<p>
I used to clearly separate this meditation from other things because I
sometimes cried. Now I sometimes find myself simultaneously aware of
it as I play with the cats, hang out with friends, talk to my parents,
or spend time with my husband. Those moments feel oddly grace-ful,
like I'm seeing one of our cats as a kitten, at the end of her life,
and beyond, all super-imposed. It's interesting to imagine who someone
was before you knew them, and to trace their impact on your life by
seeing their absence&#x2013;or even non-existence, "It's a Wonderful Life"
sort of not-existed-at-all-ness.
</p>

<p>
When I feel this way, it's easier to be appreciative and grateful for
the gift that was given. It's easier to feel safe, oddly enough,
knowing that I can look on without clinging too much.
</p>

<p>
I'm not always like this, of course. I am often less thoughtful, more
immediate. I think it would be interesting to be in that kind of
moment more often, though. Perhaps writing about it like this will
help me remember what it's like, and how to do things with that
perspective&#x2013;even in those normal moments when time is separate and
not all together.

<h4 id="unnumbered-342"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Stoic impressions: Weebles wobble but they don't fall down</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-342">
<p>
:Effort:   1:00
</p>

<p>
I'm with the Stoics rather than the Aristotelians on this one (or at least based on how I understand things): all you need for a good life is you. I'm not wise enough to know whether that's true, but I think that it's better for me to live as if that's the case instead of thinking that happiness can be that much influenced by luck and external events. Challenge accepted!
</p>

<p>
I'm starting to understand what I'd like to aspire to be when I've infused whatever wisdom I can get from philosophy into my reflexive responses to life's situations.
</p>

<p>
I'm not trying to get through life completely unruffled and serene. Stuff happens. I get sad. I get excited. I get scared. I get delighted. I react to the world around me.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, I like this ability to step outside of these impressions. I can see myself even as I laugh or cry. I can enjoy the ups and downs and yet not get carried away by them. I can be happy that something I cooked turned out well and that people liked it; and I can know that in the grand scheme of things, it's insignificant (but worth doing anyway). I can be scared about the possible downsides of something I'm going to try anyway; and I can know that in the grand scheme of things, it's insignificant (but worth doing anyway).
</p>

<p>
Whatever life throws at me, I can choose to respond and not just react. Sure, the first few moments might be more instinctive&#x2013;pain hurts, joy elates, sometimes I say the wrong thing&#x2013;but what happens after that is up to me.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to avoid getting carried away by stuff, the way people get consumed by grudges or misled by temptations. I think that's what the Stoics meant in their focus on ridding themselves of passions&#x2013;not "passion" in the modern sense of "things I feel awesome about and enjoy doing," but rather the kind of "passion" that takes over your reason and leads to suffering.
</p>

<p>
I guess I'd like to continue to be like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roly-poly_toy">roly-poly toy</a>, like the egg-shaped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeble">Weebles</a> of the slogan "Weebles wobble but they don't fall down." Then the Stoic idea of a passion would be wobbling so much and not quite being the shape that you need to be, and ending up so far off your center of mass that you stay down. Or at least until other people help you get back up. Because really, sometimes people do get wobbled more than they can handle, and that's an opportunity for other people to help out.
</p>

<p>
So far, I've been extraordinarily lucky. It's been easy to return to normal from the little things I've come across so far. You know how some video games are designed to gradually help you learn different skills and others throw you in the deep end? So far my life has been like the former. When things come, they're within my range and I have the support structure that makes them easier to deal with. So I guess that's like I'm playing a game where you get just enough wobbling so that you can correct your mass distribution or egg-shaped profile in order to wobble back better. Which is sort of Stoicism, I think. Stoicism helps with adjusting so that you can deal with bigger and bigger wobbles if you need to. Stoicism reminds you that you are not the wobble that pushes you. You don't control the wobble, so why bother stressing out about it? You can get better at bouncing back. You can work on becoming the weebliest Weeble.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes hear from people who are playing a much harder game, where they have to deal with pretty darn big wobbles before they've been able to sort things out. I'm not sure I have much to offer. Newbie tips aren't as useful for people stuck playing life on the "hardcore" setting, I guess! I can <i>say</i> that I'm working on being a better roly-poly toy and that it seems to be working out so far, but I definitely haven't wobbled as much as other people have. But maybe reflections from someone living an easier version of the game can help people think about little aspects of their own games, either from the actual thoughts or even just the process itself.
</p>

<p>
One of the thoughts that helps me is this: wobbling's what makes Weebles fun. So as much as I'm sure people wish for care-free lives, I'm okay with there being some wobbling in mine. I might not actively seek out really wobbly situations, but if they're there, they're there, and they can help me be better.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, wobble on.

<p>
There's a saying that you should live each day as if it were your
last, which is supposed to help you fully enjoy each moment. I've been
recently thinking about another way of looking at it: <b>living each day
as if <i>yesterday</i> was your last.</b> What do I mean by this? Well, let me
explain how I got around to thinking about this in the first place.
</p>

<p>
I am a bit of a pessimist when planning, which is perhaps a little
surprising to people who know me in person because I'm generally
cheerful and positive. I think it's precisely because I think about
risks and safety nets that I can easily focus on the bright side. Now,
thinking about what can go wrong often leads to dealing with ultimate
consequences. (I can't be the only one who routinely thinks about
death before biking in city traffic, am I? But I bike anyway.)
</p>

<p>
From time to time, I reassure myself that hey, life so far has been
pretty darn awesome, actually, so even if it were abruptly cut off or
made significantly more challenging, things are on the whole pretty
good. I might not have worked on things of lasting significance (and
what could <i>really</i> be significant, anyway, in a universe probably
heading towards heat death in gazillions of years?) and there may be
more awesomeness ahead of me, but even after the thirty years I've
been around so far, people have sent me e-mail and commented on my
blog and told me that some of my thoughts have been useful. In any
case, I'm happy with what I've been learning so far. That's as good
a start as any, and anything else is icing on the cake. Instead of accepting
the common view that life is incomplete unless you do X, Y, and Z, I
like to think that life is pretty good, actually, and that things just
get even more wonderful. (This is why I haven't quite gotten the hang
of bucket lists&#x2013;I don't have that burning sense of urgency and
incompleteness.)
</p>

<p>
While chasing down some notes about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomnema"><i>hypomnemata</i></a> (those personal
notes I wrote about while <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/07/whats-handbook/">thinking about my handbook</a>), I came across
Michel Foucault's <i>The Hermeneutics of the Subject</i> (2001, translated
by Graham Burchell in 2005; you might be able to <a href="http://inventingself.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2013/07/foucault-hermeneutics-of-the-subject-2.pdf">read it online</a>).
Here's the segment that got me thinking about this particular
reflection:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
With regard to our life, and this is the central point of this new
ethics of old age, we should place ourselves in a condition such that
we live it as if it is already over. In fact, even if we are still
young, even if we are adult and still active, with regard to all that
we do and all that we are we should have the attitude, behavior,
detachment, and accomplishment of someone who has already completed
his life. We must live expecting nothing more from our life and, just
as the old man is someone who expects nothing more from his life, we
must expect nothing from it even when we are young. We must complete
our life before our death. The expression is found in Seneca's letter
32: "<i>consummare vitam ante mortem.</i>" We must complete our life before
our death, we must fulfill our life before the moment of death
arrives, we must achieve perfect satiety of ourselves. "<i>Summa tui
satietas</i>": perfect, complete satiety of yourself. This is the point
towards which Seneca wants Lucilius to hasten. You can see that this
idea that we must organize our life in order to be old, that we must
hasten towards our old age, and that even if we are young we should
constitute ourselves in relation to our life as if we are old, raises
a series of important questions to which we will return.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(p110-111)
</p>

<p>
Aha! People smarter than me have thought about the same thing, but
more eloquently and more deeply than I could have. In the same
section, he writes about how society typically thinks old age is not
as awesome as youth, but actually, old age is pretty cool because
that's when all of your philosophical work comes to fruition and
you're safe from many of the things that disturb other people. This
reminds me a little of how my mom is slowly making peace with growing
old. She is not quite there yet. Sometimes it makes her sad. Oddly,
sometimes I feel older than other people; old in the sense of
accepting the shortness of life and embracing whatever we've lived so
far. Granted, I <i>am</i> only turning 31 next month, so it's quite
possible that I don't know what I'm talking about. We'll see in forty
or sixty years. But if Foucault and Seneca say something along those
lines with the advantage of quite a few years of experience (Foucalt
was maybe 55 when he gave those lectures on hermeneutics that were
later transcribed and translated for that book), maybe I'm onto
something, or maybe I can take advantage of the springboard that
they're offering.
</p>

<p>
The nice thing about reading philosophers (especially classic ones!)
is that they've often come up with short, clear ways to say things
that you've been trying to untangle. Like this, from Seneca's <a href="http://www.stoics.com/seneca_epistles_book_1.html">12th
letter</a> ("On old age"):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When a man has said: "I have lived!", every morning he arises he receives a bonus.'
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Every day above ground is a good day. This is already more than I
could have asked for, and what I have is already enough. Anything
beyond this is icing on the cake and fudge on the brownie. =)

Writing helps me make myself. In a quiet, considered moment, I can
think through things and figure out how I'd like to respond or act.
Most of the time, I don't end up referring to my old blog posts;
writing is itself enough to help. Sometimes I do link back so that I
can trace the development of a thought, build on what I've written, or
share that moment in time with someone else who's figuring out similar
things.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I have all these little thoughts that don't quite gel into a
single post. I'm still attached to the idea of having some kind of
question, some kind of realization, or at least a little progress in a
post. Sometimes I have two or more threads and I <i>feel</i> there's some
kind of connection between them, but I can't quite articulate it
coherently. I'm getting better at writing regardless, but I keep the
notes until they make a little more sense. I've been saving those
snippets in an ever-growing outline, but maybe I should just post
things. After all, present-Sacha has found the time machine of a blog
archive to be unexpectedly interesting reading, so maybe future-Sacha
will be able to make sense of all this. As Steve Jobs said (in his
2005 commencement speech at Stanford), "You can't connect the dots
looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you
have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."
</p>

<p>
Today I thought about <i>chronos</i> and <i>kairos</i>, clock-time and
personal-time. I thought about Aristotle's golden means and the vices
that my nature tends towards. I thought about our almost-daily habit
of watching movies borrowed from the library, and what we did before
this became our routine; and similarly, what were those long-ago
weekends like? Maybe I should write more about everyday life so that
future-Sacha can see the changes.
</p>

<p>
Here is what our lives are like at the moment. Mondays and Wednesdays
are quiet days at home. I skim a stack of books, taking notes on a
few. Because my consulting client needs a little extra help, I usually
interrupt my reading and writing with an hour or two of work,
responding to e-mail and dealing with quick, important requests.
Tuesdays and Thursdays are more focused on consulting. On Tuesday
evenings, I go to Hacklab to cook and hang out. Fridays I go out, meet
friends, and experiment with a change of scene. On either Saturday or
Sunday, we do laundry, groceries, cooking, and chores; the other
weekend day is for outside errands or other forms of relaxation,
although sometimes W- uses it to catch up on work.
</p>

<p>
I spend a lot more time reading and writing than I did when I worked
full-time. (From about 5 hours a week to about 19 hours!) I enjoy it
immensely. I'm beginning to feel more of a sense of the authors I
encounter through their works, both ancient and modern; their voices,
their ideas, the conversations that thread their way through the books
I read.
</p>

<p>
There's always that need to combine learning, doing, and sharing.
Book-learning isn't enough; I have to try things in real life. Doing
something is good, but sharing what I'm learning from it is even
better. My writing this year is a lot more self-focused than it was
last year, but in the grand scheme of things, a little exploration
should be all right. (Who knows, it might even be useful.)

I calculate my net worth every month, and sometimes more often out of

not drawing down the money yet. I don't really change my decisions based on this information. I'm just curious about the growth.
</p>

<p>
Still, I've been checking my finances more recently because my 31st birthday is coming up, and I'm <i>this close</i> to reaching one of those arbitrary savings thresholds.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-349">
<p>
Sometimes I hear from people who are stuck. They want to try something
that could result in more earnings, but they don't have the time to do
so because they need to focus on paid work. For freelancers, this bind
can be particularly tight if you don't have good savings or you've
exhausted your resources.
</p>

<p>
If you have savings, it's easier to take risks and try things out.
You're less worried about messing things up. If you have savings that
are dedicated for exploring opportunities in addition to a general
emergency fund, it's even easier to experiment. It's a good idea to
set aside a portion of your income for an <b>opportunity fund</b>. You can
use your opportunity fund to pay for tools, education, coaching,
services, or other time-savers. You can also use it as a safety net
when you want to spend more time and energy on your personal projects.
False starts hurt less, so you can try more. You become a capitalist,
an entrepreneur, examining the opportunities and deciding where to
deploy your money. You work on getting the best return, because you
want to feed those profits back into your opportunity fund.
</p>

<p>
I'm a natural saver, so it was easy for me to keep my wants simple and
set aside a small percentage of my income for an opportunity fund. I
remember being excited about watching the balance grow. One time, I
used my opportunity fund to buy a Nintendo DS partly for entertainment
and partly for drawing. I used that to draw my presentations, which
resulted in invitations to conferences, connections with mentors, and
a boost to my career. I took the results and confidence from that and
saved up for a professional drawing tablet, which I used to put
together something that won a competition. That success encouraged me
to take the next step of getting a tablet PC, which led me to
sketchnoting, which led to even more opportunities. Small investments
compound. I've used the opportunity fund for things that didn't work
out as well as I hoped, too, but since I limit myself to small bets
before making bigger ones, things have been okay.
</p>

<p>
But what if you don't have those savings yet?
</p>

<p>
<b>Frugality</b> can help you widen the gap between your income and your
expenses so that you can keep more money and build up your savings.
The more savings you have, the easier it is to save. For example, if
you live on the edge, it's hard to wait for sales or buy in bulk. If
you have a little more capital, though, you can take advantage of the
occasional sale on essential items, and equip yourself with the tools
and skills you need to make the most of them. Aside from finding more
cost-effective ways to do things, you might take a look at your
expenses and trim things that you'd been paying out of inattention or
limit the luxuries you enjoy. Frugality might not make you that much
richer, but it can give you breathing room.
</p>

<p>
<b>Widen your work options.</b> If your freelancing income is unpredictable
and this is wreaking havoc on your finances, consider taking a stabler
job (even if it's less exciting). Build up your savings and work on
your passion projects in your off hours. Then, when you've got the
safety net you need in order to do well, make the jump again. Many
people rule out certain types of jobs as beneath them, but if you
shift your perspective, you might be able to make it work for you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Learn to sell.</b> Let's say that you want to keep freelancing and
working on your own projects because you're worried that you might
forget your dreams if you're distracted by a regular job. Learn to
sell, then. Find out how to communicate more value so that you can
earn more. See if you can break your project down into smaller parts
and sell those. Instead of waiting until you find the time to finish
an entire book, try to publish shorter guides and resources. If
there's a project you really want to work on but you can't carve out
enough time to work on it, see if you can pre-sell the idea to people
who might find it useful and who are willing to contribute to its
development.
</p>

<p>
I think the best thing of all is to build yourself that safety net&#x2013;
usually a combination of savings and a frugal lifestyle&#x2013;so that you
can
</p>

<p>
Want that freedom more than you want a moment's entertainment,
convenient food, or other comforts.

<p>
I've been reading a lot about early frugal living. I read Henry David
Thoreau's <a href="http://thoreau.eserver.org/walden00.html">Walden</a> (1854), and I followed a link in a <a href="http://simple-living-in-suffolk.co.uk/2014/07/ralph-borsodi-and-a-codicil-to-two-years-on/">blog post</a> to Ralph
Borsodi's <a href="http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0303critic/030302borsodi.ugly/030302borsodi.toc.html">This Ugly Civilization</a> (1929) and thence to his <a href="http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0302hsted/030204borsodi/030204borsoditoc.html">Flight from
the City</a> (1933, during the Great Depression - particularly poignant
bits in the chapter on security versus insecurity). Both authors
provided detailed breakdowns of their expenses and descriptions of
their methods, fleshing out philosophies of simple living. There's
much that I don't agree with, but there are also many ideas that I
recognize and can learn even more from. I'd probably get along with
the authors, and their mental voices will be handy to keep in my mind.
I found both of them somewhat more relatable than Ralph Waldo Emerson
in his essays, but I'm sure Emerson will yield additional insights on
re-reading.
</p>

<p>
Both Thoreau and Borsodi emphasized the freedom you get (or keep!) by
minimizing your wants. Thoreau wrote, "&#x2026; for my greatest skill has
been to want but little." Borsodi points out the artificiality of many
desires as products of a factory-oriented culture that must have
people buy the things that factories produce. By questioning your
wants and becoming as self-sufficient as you can be, you free yourself
from the restrictions many other people have. In a way, it's a
follow-up from what I'm learning from Epictetus. I like how the Greeks
tend to be more about living in society instead of going away from it,
though.
</p>

<p>
Homesteading is a big thing for both Thoreau and Borsodi. I'm not
particularly curious about exploring homesteading at the moment. City
bylaws ban keeping chickens, and I still struggle with garden
productivity. The city is all I know so far. W- and J- both have
reasons to be here. Besides, the Toronto Public Library system and a
decent, reliable connection to Internet are doing amazing things for
my learning at the moment. Perhaps someday, but not now. In the
meantime, despite Borsodi's disdain for the stock market, I like the
fact that it's doing well. The gains are much less than Virginia
Woolf's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_of_One's_Own">five hundred a year</a> (about US$45,000 these days), but I don't
need that much to live well, anyway. Still, I'm going to keep working
on some skills for independent living (cooking, sewing, repairing,
making, etc.), since I can do that wherever I am.

<p>
Onward!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-351">
<p>
When you're learning something complex, it can help to break it down
into small steps and figure out what sequence is right for
<b>you</b>&#x2013;especially if there are lots of other people who want to
influence your decision.
</p>

<p>
Let's take investing, for example. There are all sorts of businesses
built around making you want to earn more, all sorts of complex
instruments that seem to enrich advisors more than clients, and all
sorts of decisions that you can make that can either help you or screw
up your life. Me, I'm trying to learn slowly.
</p>

<p>
I'm a conservative investor. I don't need to beat the market. In fact,
I'd like to stay as close to average as I can. I don't need to be
smarter than other people who are buying and selling. Even if I have
plenty of time, I don't want to spend that time and attention on
tracking financial news. Baby steps - one lesson at a time.
</p>

<p>
I started by saving up. Then I opened up an investing account with TD
and started with their e-series funds, since those had low management
expense ratios and no commissions. After years of annually stashing
money into TD e-series index funds, I'm now relatively confident about
my ability to not panic based on the ups and downs of the market. The
stock market has been practically all up since I started, actually.
I've been investing at the rate I previously set for myself. I haven't
figured out the best way of transferring larger amounts from the
corporation yet, but that can wait. In the meantime, it's a good
buffer for emergencies, and it means I can think of corrections as a
good thing.
</p>

<p>
Over the past two years, I've gradually learned to think of my TFSA +
RRSP + locked-in RRSP + non-registered investments as one big bucket
to manage instead of having multiple allocations in multiple accounts.
I sold some units (for the first time!) in order to shuffle my
allocation around, simplifying my paperwork a little. I still have
some duplicates because there's only so much each account can hold,
but ah well. I've only ever sold units within tax-sheltered accounts,
so I still haven't gone through the exercise of calculating my
adjusted cost base for the e-funds in my non-registered account.
</p>

<p>
I briefly considered real estate, but I don't think real estate is the
right fit for me (yet? at all?). It's a big commitment that I don't
know enough about. Sure, there are probably upsides, but there are
also scary downsides&#x2013;especially with Ontario's tenant laws, which
make it difficult to evict people if there are problems.
</p>

<p>
I've also thought about ETFs. After crunching the numbers, I don't
think my portfolio size is large enough to justify switching. I'd
probably save a little in fees, but it adds complexity.
</p>

<p>
For me, the next step is probably to sell a token amount from my
non-registered holdings so that I can practice calculating the
adjusted cost basis (and so that any tax penalties are also pretty
small in case I totally mess up). Slowly leveling up!

</p>

<p>
I’ve been reading through Mr. Money Mustache’s blog archive, and his blog post on What would you do with WAY MORE money? made me think about what I value and what I would change. Like him, I’m comfortable with the way things are. I like eating at home. I like getting books and movies from the library instead of buying them. (No storage or waste issues, wide selection, and the satisfaction of boosting library circulation statistics…) I like my hobbies and interests. I like my freedom from the endless hedonic treadmill.
Not even the latest apps or gadgets, aside from the occasional experiment. (Shh! I hope they don’t take away my geek card. ;) )
About the only thing that would be awesomer would be to make more frequent trips to the Philippines (maybe every year! or on a whim!) or to join family and friends on their vacations. Although that’s constrained by other things too, like the fact that I like spending time with W- and he needs to be here in Toronto for J-.

It’s finally spring in full force, and I’ve been biking whenever I can get away with it. The bike ride is a little faster than the subway commute to my client, and I like not have to squeeze into the crowded train. Free exercise along a well-maintained trail with plenty of flowers and trees…

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-363">
<p>
I'd been contemplating this question for the past four years.
</p>

<p>
What's worth spending on? I invest for the future, save for unexpected expenses, and support causes and people - but it's good to have that discretionary part of my budget which I can use to enjoy life and learn how to make better decisions.
</p>

<p>
Many people care about stuff. I apporeciate that. There are many examples of things that have enabled me to enjoy and learn from life so much more, such as my tablet PC.
</p>

<p>
Many people care about experiences. I appreciate that, too. I like how experiences can lead to deeper relationships.
</p>

<p>
Many people know something else that I'm just beginning to figure out. You can spend on people, on time, on making things happen. This is awesome! There's a candy store of talent out there - a world full of people with unique experiences, skills, and passions.
</p>

<p>
Like the way I've learned about what works well for me in terms of
spending on stuff and experiences, I want to learn how to spend on
making things happen. And who knows? If I can get good enough at it,
maybe I can learn how to create so much value that it becomes a
self-perpetuating machine.

<p>
This year, I am going to become the sort of person who exercises
regularly. I'm not particularly concerned about reaching a certain
weight, but I'd like to improve my strength and endurance. W- is
helping me ease into the learn-to-run program he did at work. I'm also
starting from the first rung on the <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html">fitness ladder</a> from The Hacker's
Diet. Small activities like these don't take a lot of time, and the
gradual progression will help me build confidence.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to turn more exercise activities into ones that W- and I
can share. Krav maga isn't my cup of tea, but I think I'll like
jogging and walking with W-. We can stretch or do some weight-training
while watching videos. Biking is fun, too.
</p>

<p>
What does making fitness part of me mean? I think it means being in
tune with how things work, paying attention to the details and the
changes. It's probably like the way <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/06/garden-becoming-part-daily-life/">daily gardening</a> has changed my
experience of the backyard compared to when I dabbled in it. I'm
looking forward to trying more things and learning more.
</p>

<p>
Identity is a big factor when it comes to maintaining good habits.
When you make something part of who you are, it's easier to keep doing
it, and it's harder to neglect it. Here are some of the other identity
changes I've gone through:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I changed from someone who takes transit all the time to someone who
bikes whenever she can.
</li>
<li>I changed from someone who hated writing for school to someone who
enjoys writing for this blog.
</li>
<li>I changed from someone who grew up around household staff (cook,
maids) to someone who cooks practically all her meals and takes care
of her own chores.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have the time, space, and support I need, and it's good for me. I
can see the results of good habits and the consequences of poor ones.
And I'm going to do it without gym memberships or other things like
that. We already have all the tools I need, so I just have to do it. =)

Sometimes it's hard to plan ahead because there are just too many
factors to consider, too many things I don't know, too many divergent
paths. I can come up with different scenarios, but I can't figure out
a lot of things that would make sense in all the likely scenarios.
Some of the scenarios are exciting, but some of them are also scary.
They're hard to hold in my mind. They fight my imagination. I can't
plan straight for these. I can't come up with step 1, step 2, step 3.
At best, I can come up with if-then-elses, but I still have to wait
and see how things turn out.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it's easier to take life one day at a time, because if I
think about too large a chunk, I start getting lost. Sometimes it's
better to not focus on everything that's needed, just what's needed
right now.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file:~/Dropbox/Inbox/To blog/2014-11-11 Dealing with uncertainty one step at a time.png" alt="2014-11-11 Dealing with uncertainty one step at a time.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
It rattles me a little bit because I'm more used to seeing clearer
paths. Or do I only think that I'm used to that?
</p>

<p>
Let me try to remember when I felt that sense of clarity and
certainty. I was certain about taking computer science; I loved
programming even as a kid. I was certain about teaching after
graduation; I loved helping people learn. I was certain about taking a
technical internship in Japan; it was an interesting thing to do. I
was certain about taking my master's degree; it was a logical next
step, necessary for teaching, and the research was interesting.
</p>

<p>
I was not certain about being in Canada, and I was often homesick
during my studies. But I was certain about W-, and now this place also
feels like home. I was certain about IBM and about the people and
ideas I wanted to work with. I was certain about saving up an
opportunity fund so that I could explore other things someday. I was
certain about starting this 5-year experiment with semi-retirement.
</p>

<p>
So I'm familiar with what it's like to plan for a chunk of certainty -
half a year, four years, decades. It feels good when a plan comes
together, when I can see how each step leads to a future I've already
lived in my head.
</p>

<p>
I am certain, now, that I'm going in roughly the right direction. I
don't know exactly how it will work out, but I know that it will be
interesting.
</p>

<p>
Ah! There it is, I think, the thing I'm trying to grasp. The future
Sacha of this five-year experiment is fuzzy in my head. That
evaluation point is only two years away now, and I should be able to
imagine her more clearly. But aside from a few abstract
characteristics (future Sacha is a better developer and writer, future
Sacha continues to be happy, future Sacha gets to work on what she
wants), I don't have a good sense of her yet - not with the same
solidity of past futures. I'm not sure what to put on that <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/11/11/are-you-giving-the-shaft-to-your-future-self/">Conveyor
Belt of Time</a> (as Mr. Money Mustache puts it) aside from
generically-useful gifts to my future self: decent finances,
relationships, skills.
</p>

<p>
Circling back to the metaphor that emerged while I was drawing and
writing my way through this question, I suppose this is like the
difference between hiking along a trail with a view - or even unmarked
ground, but with landmarks for orienting yourself - versus exploring
the woods. Not that I know much of the latter; I've never been lost in
the woods before, never strayed from the safety of a trail or the
sight of a road. (Well, except maybe that one time we were hiking
along the Bruce Trail and got turned around a little bit, and we ended
up scrambling up a slope to find the trail we really wanted to be on.)
</p>

<p>
I can learn to enjoy exploring, knowing that in the worst-case
scenario, I've got the figurative equivalent of supplies, a GPS,
emergency contacts, backup batteries and so on. I can learn to enjoy
observing the world, turning questions and ideas over, noticing what's
interesting about them, perhaps cracking things open in order to learn
more. I can learn to take notes, make maps, tidy up trails, and leave
other gifts for people who happen to wander by that way.
</p>

<p>
Ah. That might be it. Let's give that a try.

I've been out-sleeping our cats, I think, which is really saying
something. I don't expect this to be a permanent change in my
schedule, but it's interesting to think about how I could adapt to it
if I anticipate being like this for several months or longer.
</p>

<p>
Based on my time data from six days (which is totally long enough to
draw conclusions, for sure), I've been awake for an average of 5.2
hours before going back to bed, with a median of 4.4 hours and a
pretty-hard-to-plan-for standard deviation of 2.9 hours. So that means
I can sometimes stay up for a normal day, and sometimes I'm out after
1.6 hours. (Although some of that is because I allow myself to nap
instead of pushing myself harder, I'm sure.)
</p>

<p>
So I'm awake in spurts. Sometimes I have plenty of energy during those
times (like now), and sometimes I feel pretty bleah (but usually still
okay enough to, say, go through my Japanese flashcards). I've been
catching up on reading technical documentation. I'm pretty good at
picking sleep over video games if I'm feeling really out of it. I've
also been practising drawing, since it amuses me to be able to sketch
my memories of our cats in awkward situations. (Like that time Leia
was going to jump over a cable and misjudged it, ended up swaying
gently in mid-air&#x2026;)
</p>

I was thinking about how I can use these snippets of time to improve
in programming, writing, and drawing. I realized that although I can
easily imagine how other people can write or draw using fragmented
time (writers scribbling in notebooks on top of washing machines,
artists doodling on the subway), programming seems a lot less
tractable. It doesn't feel like you can break it up and squeeze it
into different parts of your day as much.
</p>

<p>
It is generally accepted that context switching is evil when it comes
to programming. So I've been carrying around this idea that Real
Programmers are people who can pull all-nighters hacking on tough
problems, holding elaborate structures in their heads. Your standard
hero programmer stereotype, with the pinnacle being someone either
building complex, cool stuff, possibly maintaining large and useful
open source software.
</p>

<p>
Hence this little mental disconnect. I'm pretty certain I can get
there someday if I really want to, but probably not if I extrapolate
from current circumstances. Even maintaining a tiny piece of software
sounds like more commitment than I want at the moment. (Heck, I might
go a week without responding to e-mail.)
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I spent my first few working years in a corporate
environment, where mentors showed me that it's totally possible to be
an Awesome Geek while still working a roughly 9-to-5 job, having
families and hobbies, and getting plenty of sleep. Thank goodness. So
I have this alternate model in my head, not of a Hero Programmer, but
rather of solid contributors who keep making gradual progress, help
teams of people become more productive, and who enjoy solving
interesting challenges and expanding their skills.
</p>

<p>
So let's say that I want to play with my assumption that programming
is the sort of thing that's hard to squeeze into the nooks and
crannies of one's day, at least not the way writing and drawing can. I
know that I can go through technical documentation and design
resources even if my mind isn't completely awake, and I can still pick
up useful things.
</p>

<p>
What is it about writing and drawing that make them suitable even in
small doses, and how can I tweak programming? Writers can think about
stuff during other activities. I can reflect on ideas while walking or
cooking, for example. When I program, I still need more of that
back-and-forth with a computer and an Internet connection, but maybe
I'll need less of that as I develop more experience. I can set pen to
paper during any spare moment, sketching a quick line and seeing where
it takes me from there. I might not be able to do that with
implementation, but I can use that same playfulness to explore design.
Behavior-driven development makes it easier to break projects down
into tiny, clear steps, and have a way of verifying progress (without
too much backsliding!). Getting deeper into frameworks and tools will
help me do more with less effort when I do sit down at a computer.
</p>

<p>
Okay. I can do this. Worst-case scenario, I just move slowly until I
get past this particular phase. I've seen role models who've pulled
that off well, so that's totally cool. Best-case scenario, I figure
out how to hack around some of my current cognitive limitations, and
maybe that might help other people who find themselves in the same
situation too.
</p>

<p>
This could work.

<p>
If I wanted to, I could spend more time consulting. This would make my
clients happy. It would help me create much more value, and they would
get more value from me than from other ways they could spend their
budget. I would improve my skills along the way, especially with
people's requests and feedback. And to top it all off, I would earn
more money that I could add to my savings, exchange for other people's
time or talents, or use to improve our quality of life.
</p>

<p>
It's really tempting, but I'm making myself say no, at least for now.
I'm keeping my consulting to roughly one day a week. I might do more
if there's something where I can't resist making a difference or if
our situation changes significantly. I expect that <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/learning-work-things/">learning to work on
my own things</a> will mean encountering and dealing with inner
Resistance. I expect that my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/5-year-experiment-conversation-anxious-side-sharing-time-might-better-giving-money/">anxious side</a> will whisper its self-doubt.
So I lash myself to the mast and sail past the Sirens, heading towards
(if I'm lucky!) years of wandering.

</p>

<p>
Part of this is the realization that even after my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/delegation">experiments with
delegation</a>, I'm still not good at converting money back into time,
learning, ability, or enjoyment.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Extra money tends to go into projects, tools or cooking experiments.
Gardening is one of my luxuries: a few bags of dirt, some seeds and
starters, and an excuse to be outside regularly. Paying someone to do
the first draft of a transcript gets around my impatience with
listening to my own voice. Aside from these regular decisions, I tend
to think carefully about what I spend on. Often a low-cost way of
doing something also helps me learn a lot - sometimes much more than
throwing money at the problem would.
</p>

</p>

<p>
But there <b>are</b> things that money can buy, and it's good for me to
learn how to make better decisions about that. For example, a big
savings goal might be "buying" more of W-'s time, saving up in case he
wants to experiment with a more self-directed life as well. House
maintenance projects need tools, materials, and sometimes skilled
help. Cooking benefits from experimentation, better ingredients, and
maybe even instruction.

</p>

<p>
What about accelerating my learning so that I can share even more
useful stuff? Working with other people can help me:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>take advantage of external perspectives (great for editing)
</li>
<li>organize my learning path into a more effective sequence
</li>
<li>learn about adjacent possibilities and low-hanging fruit
</li>
<li>bridge gaps
</li>
<li>improve through feedback
</li>
<li>create scaffolds/structures and feed motivation
</li>
<li>set up and observe deliberate practice
</li>
<li>direct my awareness to what's important
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In order to make the most of this, I need to get better at:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>identifying what I want to learn
</li>
<li>identifying who I can learn from
</li>
<li>approaching them and setting up a relationship
</li>
<li>experimenting 
</li>
<li>following up
</li>
</ul>

<p>
How have I invested money into learning, and what have the results been like?
</p>

<p>
<b>Tools?</b> Yup, totally worth it, even for the tools I didn't end up
using much of (ex: ArtRage). Do more of this. How can I get better at:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>keeping an eye out for potentially useful tools: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emacs packages
</li>
<li>AutoHotkey scripts/ideas
</li>
<li>Windows/Linux tools related to writing, drawing, coding
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>evaluating whether a tool can fit my workflow
</li>
<li>supporting people who make good tools
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>expressing appreciation
</li>
<li>contributing code
</li>
<li>writing about tools
</li>
<li>sending money
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Books?</b> Some books have been very useful. On the other hand, the
library has tons of books, so I have an infinite backlog of free
resources. Buying and sketchnoting new books (or going to author
events) is good for connecting with authors and readers about the book
du jour, but on the other hand, I also get a lot of value from
focusing on classics that I want to remember.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conferences?</b> Mostly interesting for meeting people and bumping into
them online through the years. Best if I go as a speaker (makes
conversations much easier and reduces costs) and/or as a sketchnoter
(long-term value creation). It would be even awesomer if I could
combine this with in-person intensive learning, like a hackathon or a
good workshop&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
<b>Courses?</b> Meh. Not really impressed by the online courses I've taken
so far, but then again, I don't think I'm <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/10/coming-terms-online-courses/">approaching them with the
right mindset either</a>.
</p>

<p>
Things I will carve out opportunity-fund space for so that I can try
more of them:
</p>

<p>
<b>Pairing/coaching/tutoring?</b> Tempting, especially in terms of <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/emacs-coaching-unknowns-figuring-want-learn/">Emacs</a>,
Node/Javascript, Rails, or Japanese. For example, some goals might be:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn how to improve Emacs Lisp performance and reliability: profiling, code patterns, tests, etc.
</li>
<li>Define and adopt better Emacs habits
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing
</li>
<li>Organization
</li>
<li>Planning
</li>
<li>Programming
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write more elegant and testable Javascript
</li>
<li>Set up best-practices Javascript/CSS/HTML/Rails environment in Emacs
</li>
<li>Learn how to take advantage of new features in Wordpress
</li>
<li>Write more other-directed posts
</li>
<li>Get better at defining what I want to learn and reaching out to people
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Actually, in general, how does one accelerate learning?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>General learning techniques:</b> spaced repetition, skill breakdowns, deliberate practice&#x2026;
</li>
<li><b>Structure and motivation:</b> personal trainers, courses
</li>
<li><b>Instruction and perspective:</b> expert, peer, or external
</li>
<li><b>Higher-quality resources:</b> original research, well-written/organized resources, richer media, good level of detail, experience/authority
</li>
<li><b>Better tools:</b> things are often much easier and more fun
</li>
<li><b>Experimentation:</b> learning from experience, possibly coming up with new observations
</li>
<li><b>Feedback, analysis:</b> experience, thoroughness
</li>
<li><b>Immersion:</b> languages, retreats
</li>
<li><b>Outsourcing:</b> research, summaries, scale, skills, effort
</li>
<li><b>Relationships:</b> serendipity, connection, conversation, mentoring, sponsorship
</li>
<li><b>Community:</b> premium courses or membership sites often offer this as a benefit
</li>
<li><b>Freedom:</b> safety net that permits experimentation, time to focus on it instead of worrying about bills, etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmm. I have some experience in investing in better tools,
higher-quality resources, experimentation, feedback/analysis,
delegation, and freedom. I'd like to get better at that and at
investing in relationships and outsourcing. Come to think of it, that
might be more useful than focusing on learning from
coaching/instruction, at least for now.
</p>

<p>
Let me imagine what using money to accelerate learning would be like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Relationships
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Get to know individuals faster and deeper
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free: Build org-contacts profiles of people who are part of my
tribe (people who comment/link/interact); think about them on a
regular basis
</li>
<li>Free: Proactively reach out and explore shared interests/curiosities
</li>
<li><b>$:</b> Figure out digital equivalent of treating people to lunch or
coffee: conversation + maybe investing time into creating a good
resource for them and other people + sending cash, donating to
charity, or (best) cultivating reciprocal learning
</li>
<li><b>$:</b> Sign up for a CRM that understands Gmail, Twitter, and
maybe even Disqus
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify things to learn about and reach out to people who are good role models for those skills
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free: Be specific about things I want to learn
</li>
<li>Free: Find people who know how to do those things (maybe delegate research)
</li>
<li><b>$:</b> Apply their advice
</li>
<li><b>$:</b> Reach out with results and questions, maybe an offer to donate to their favourite charity
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Help the community (<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/improving-evil-plans-emacs/">like Emacs evil plans</a>; rising tide lifts all boats)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>$:</b> Invest time and money into creating good resources
</li>
<li>Be approachable
</li>
<li><b>$:</b> Bring the community together. Invest in
platforms/organization. For example, I can use whatever I would
have spent on airfare to create a decent virtual conference
experience, or figure out the etiquette of having an assistant
set up and manage Emacs Hangouts/Chats.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outsourcing 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify things that I want to do, regardless of skills
</li>
<li><b>$:</b> Experiment with outsourcing parts that I don't know how to do
yet (or even the ones I can do but want external perspectives on)
</li>
<li>Use the results to determine what I actually want and what to
learn more about; iterate as needed
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Huh, that's interesting. When I start thinking about investing in
learning, I tend to fixate on finding a coach because I feel a big gap
around directly asking people for help. But I can invest in other ways
that might be easier or more effective to start with. Hmm&#x2026; Thoughts?

<p>
Can a sharing model based on free/pay-what-you-want resources be
sustainable over a long period of time?
</p>

<p>
I've been thinking about this for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One of my assistants e-mailed me about <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/rethinking-delegation/">my difficulties with
delegation</a>. He suggested thinking of my life as a business: What
would my objectives be? When I reflected on that, I realized I had
some discomfort around the ideas of customers and business models.
Was my life more like science and exploration? Not quite, either. I
left the thread of thought unresolved.
</li>
<li>Problogger posted this <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2015/01/06/make-money-blogging-start-the-new-year-by-increasing-your-income-streams/">mind map of different ways to monetize a
blog</a>. I realized that I'm not keen on advertising, physical
products, selling/flipping blogs, premium
content/communities/products, affiliate marketing (except for
books I like, and even then those offer tiny commissions and
it feels a little hypocritical to do that given that I hardly ever
buy books myself), and other indirect methods. I might be okay with
coaching, if I can come up with a good workaround for the impostor
syndrome.
</li>
<li>In an interview about Quantified Self and life experiments, a
journalist asked me to describe my business. I felt that social
business consulting wasn't the real crux of my current life's work,
and that talking about writing and publishing e-books would be
incomplete without exploring why free/pay-what-you-want pricing is
important to me. Answering his question prompted me to think about
my motivations a bit more.
</li>
<li>Harold Jarche wrote about <a href="http://jarche.com/2015/01/the-exposure-economy/">the exposure economy</a> and his decision to
limit his sharing. I understand where he's coming from - by mom
gives similar lectures to aspiring photographers who have yet to
internalize that "exposure" won't buy them new equipment. But
there's something else that drives me to share <b>more</b>, not less, and
I want to understand that.
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ljconrad/status/554657853966147584">@ljconrad</a> retweeted a link to <a href="http://highability.org/521/the-gift-of-being-uncommon/">The Gift of Being Uncommon</a>, which
included a segment on "gift reciprocity versus market economy." It
says that people "may have difficulty charging sufficiently for
their work, especially if they view their own abilities, products or
insights as gifts that need to be shared with others." I've
requested Lewis Hyde's book <i>The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in
the Modern World</i> from the library, and I'm looking forward to digging into it further.
</li>
<li>The contrast of a gift culture versus a market economy reminded me
of Eric S. Raymond's <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/">"Homesteading the Noosphere"</a> (2000). I revisited its
sections on gift culture, art, and reward. It made me think: Is
reputation a major driver for me? How does this work out if my ideal
outcome does not involve parlaying that reputation into economic
opportunities like jobs or gigs?
</li>
<li>And that reminded me of Tom Morkes' guide to <a href="http://blog.gumroad.com/post/75707736685/is-pay-what-you-want-pricing-for-you">pay what you want
pricing</a>, and the breadth of people using the PWYW strategy. I'm
always delighted to get a note from Gumroad that someone has
purchased one of my resources, but I'm still working on getting my
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27781&shareadraft=baba27781_54b00c3c5784c">anxious side</a> to accept that this is okay.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So that's my context.
</p>

<p>
Mulling all those things, I realized that the model I can use to
understand my desire to share isn't business (with its customers,
markets, and exchanges of value) or modern science (with its funding
from institutions and competition around publications).
</p>

<p>
It's <b>philosophy</b>. Ancient philosophy, not professionalized modern
philosophy.
</p>

<p>
What were the "business models" for ancient Greek and Roman
philosophers? How did they sustain themselves?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15644689403/">2015.01.10 How did schools of philosophy work in ancient Greece and Rome &#x2013; index card #independence #philosophy</a>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15642166954/">2015.01.10 More about philosophers &#x2013; index card #independence</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Cynics begged in the streets. (I'd rather avoid that option.)
</li>
<li>People or schools received gifts (from students, from other people
in the community, etc.).
</li>
<li>People or schools had rich patrons.
</li>
<li>People charged tuition, offered private tutoring, and so on.
</li>
<li>People worked in unrelated occupations. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthes">Cleanthes</a>
  philosophized during the day and carried water at night.
</li>
<li>People had private means: estates, investments, and so
forth. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger">Seneca</a> had a fortune (acquired through less-palatable means). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Pomponius_Atticus">Atticus</a> inherited wealth and grew it through real estate.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some philosophers taught in closed schools: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> kept an
exclusive brotherhood. Others taught in public, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Zeno</a> did.
</p>

<p>
I don't quite think of what I do as philosophy, but I can learn from
how these schools worked. For example, using philosophy as a lens, it
makes sense to me to share in public for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More people can learn.
</li>
<li>Ideas stand a greater chance of being remembered and used. (By other
people, and by me!)
</li>
<li>I can grow from the conversation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This last point is particularly important to me. I'm still figuring
things out. I don't feel that I'm quite at the stage where I can teach
people well - when I have clear paths and well-tested lessons. I'm
still at the stage where I try to live as well as I can, making and
sharing useful things. People's questions often help me realize
something I didn't know I knew. I'm nowhere close to sharing wisdom
suitable for the ages (and might never be).
</p>

</p>

<p>
With that learner's perspective, it doesn't make sense to me to limit
the circle of people I can reach, or to charge people for the
privilege of my being able to learn from them. But it does make sense
to be open to gifts - of money, sure, but especially of time, skills,
experience, and perspective.

</p>

<p>
In fact, reflecting on how ancient philosophers managed their ups and
downs helped me address more of my anxiety over whether a financial
mistake might break this freedom. After all, life back then was way
more volatile than life is now. What's a downturn in the stock market
like compared to the whims of emperors and the possibility of exile? I
have fewer pressures on my life and more resources than people back
then could imagine. (Searchable books! The Internet! Amazing text
editors! Boggle.) If I want to learn about interesting things,
potential changes in my situation shouldn't stop me.
</p>

<p>
So here we are. I don't know if Kevin Kelly is right about <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/">1,000 True
Fans</a> (or John Scalzi about a <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2008/03/12/the-nagging-details-about-1000-true-fans/">larger, more modest base</a>). "Fan" isn't
quite what I'm going for, anyway. I want co-adventurers,
co-figure-out-ers - ideas bumping into each other in conversations,
the back-and-forth of experiments. Maybe a teacher will appear and
guide me. Maybe students will help me discover what I can teach. I've
found some role models to help me understand sharing, and I'm looking
forward to seeing if that can still work in the modern world - or
better yet, what we can do with it.

Having resolved to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27760&shareadraft=baba27760_54aaee206a1d6">learn how to work on my own things</a>, I'm
experimenting with reducing my consulting to one day a week (from last
year's routine of two days a week). I spend most of the week reading,
drawing, writing, experimenting, and coding.

</p>

<p>
It's not a big change in terms of hours. I already have plenty of time
for personal projects. But I feel the shift in the balance. I can hear
that inner self-doubt saying, "Is this real work? Is it worthwhile? Is
it sustainable? Are you undermining your safety by goofing off?"

</p>

<p>
It's okay. I expected this resistance, this anxiety. It's just one of
those mental barriers I have to break. Fortunately, all those Stoic
philosophers are there to remind me that it's just a negative
impression, not reality, and the truth is that I have nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
I'm getting better at telling that anxious part of my mind: "Look.
Even though I offer all those resources for free, people willingly pay
for it. And other people write wonderful comments and send me e-mail
telling me that I've inspired them to learn more and that they want to
help, so that counts too. Yeah, there's a chance I might need to go
back to Regular Work if the stock market crashes or a catastrophe
happens, but in the meantime, just give this a chance. And really,
that scenario isn't the end of the world. Other people do okay. I can
too. Besides, that's why we have safety nets, right?"

<p>
And then my anxious side goes, "Okay, you've probably got the basics
covered. But what if your expenses grow, or W- gets tired of living
frugally and wants to upgrade lifestyles a little bit?"
</p>

<p>
And then I say, "We'll probably have some time to adjust our plans for
that, and I can always go back to doing Real Work that satisfies you.
Besides, if we want to upgrade our life experiences, learning the
skills to make stuff for ourselves often works out better than buying
things. Like cooking!"
</p>

<p>
(It's true! It's even called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect">IKEA effect</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Then my anxious side goes, "Fine. Maybe you have enough space to
experiment right now. You want to learn things and help people. But
look at your blog! It's so self-centred. You talk about your questions
and reflections, and you rarely give people tips they can directly
apply to their lives."
</p>

<p>
Then I say, "I'll get better at writing for other people. In the
meantime, this seems to be working okay so far. People translate my
reflections into stuff that they can use."
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15586970103/">2015.01.04 What kind of difference do I want to make, and for whom &#x2013;
index card</a>
</p>

<p>
Here's how I think my blog helps other people at the moment. Maybe you
come across my blog because of a search. You find something that saves
you a little time. You browse around a little and learn about things
you didn't even think about searching for. Maybe you come back once in
a while for more of those ideas. You bump into other topics you're
curious about, and you explore. You might <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/subscribe/">subscribe</a>, even though you
know I post practically every day. You skim the headlines for things
that interest you, and you dive into stuff you like. Sometimes you
might even feel moved to comment, e-mail, invest time, or even send
some money.
</p>

<p>
My anxious side grumbles, "Okay. I'm not sure your blog counts as Real
Work, but I'll grant that people seem to find <i>some</i> value in it. I'd
feel better if you were more serious about building a business around
it - if you could cover more of your expenses with this instead of
consulting income or dividends."
</p>

<p>
To which I say, "You know, I'm not sure any amount of money would get
you to the point of not worrying. Besides, it's good that you worry,
because that helps keep us safe. This stream will grow as I figure out
how to make things that are truly valuable to people. I bet you I can
pull it off while still keeping the free/pay-what-you-want aspect,
because that's important to me. Given that you tend to squirrel away
additional money to build up safety instead of getting better at
investing it to build up capabilities, what we really should be
thinking about is if we can make better exchanges of <b>time</b> instead of
money. That will probably make a bigger difference anyway."
</p>

<p>
My anxious side is sufficiently boggled by that idea and can't come
up with a good rejoinder. This is promising. Let me dig into it further, then.
</p>

<p>
One of the concepts I picked up from <i>Your Money or Your Life</i>
(Dominguez and Robin, 1999) is that you can think of money in terms of
the time it took you to earn it, a sobering thought when you apply it
to your expenses.
</p>

<p>
I can apply that idea to other people, too; if other people pay money
for something I made, it represents the chunk of their life that they
spent earning it (and the opportunity cost of anything else they
could've bought or invested in, including saving up for their own
freedom).
</p>

<p>
I'm frugal (bordering on being a cheapskate), having gotten very good
at making the most of inexpensive resources. Because of the <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy">typical
mind fallacy</a>, I tend to think that other people should be frugal as
well so that they can save up for their own freedom. I suspect that
people might get marginally more value from saving that money than I
would get from them giving it to me, since their stress reduction or
freedom expansion will likely outweigh my slightly increased feeling
of safety. On the other hand, people do get value from feeling
generous and from patronizing something that they would like to see
flourish, so I can agree with that.
</p>

<p>
If we translate it back to time, though, I'm more comfortable with the
exchange.
</p>

<p>
I already have enough time for the priorities in my life, while many
people feel that they don't have enough time for the priorities in
theirs. Adding more money to my life doesn't easily translate into
additional or more effective time (aside from transcripts and tools,
which I already budget for), while translating that money back into
time might make more of a difference in other people's lives. So a
direct swap doesn't make sense.
</p>

<p>
However, if we can exchange time in an apples-and-oranges sort of way,
that might make sense. That is, if someone gives me 15 minutes of
their time that translates to much more than 15 minutes of my time or
might even be something I could not do on my own, that would be
fantastic. This could be something that takes advantage of someone's:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>experience or particular mix of interests
</li>
<li>ideas, knowledge
</li>
<li>perspective (writing, coding, and all sorts of things can be
improved with the perspective of someone <b>who is not me</b>)
</li>
<li>questions
</li>
<li>connections
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Technically, delegation is supposed to help me translate money into
time that is qualitatively different from my time, but my anxious side
has not been very good at evaluating, trusting, or making the most of
learning from people who know different things than I do.
</p>

<p>
Figuring out a way to <b>effectively receive other people's gifts of time</b> might be what I need to break through this barrier.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16180954226/">2015.01.04 Thinking in terms of an exchange of time &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>In fact, receiving time might be more effective than receiving
money.</b> Not only could that get around my difficulty with finding and
paying other people for the qualitatively different time that I want,
but if we structure it right, people will <b>gain</b> from the time that
they give. If someone asks me a good question that prompts me to
learn, reflect on, or share something, we both gain. If they invest
more time into experimenting with the ideas, we gain even more. I
can't actually <b>buy</b> that on any of the freelancing or outsourcing
marketplaces. There's no way for me to convert money into that kind of
experience.
</p>

<p>
So, how can people can give me 15 minutes of time in a way that helps
them and helps me? Let me think about different things I'm learning about:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16052554827/">2015.01.09 Time is greater than money &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16212510076/">2015.01.09 What am I learning more about, and how can people help &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
It makes sense to organize this by interest instead of by action.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Emacs:</b> Ask a question, pass along a tip, share a workflow. Also, I
really appreciate people showing up at Emacs Hangouts or being on
Emacs Chats, because my anxious side is always firmly convinced that
this will be the day when no one else shows up to a party or that
conversation will be super-awkward.
</li>

<li><b>Coding in general:</b> There are <b>so</b> many ways I want to improve in
order to become a better programmer. I should set up continuous
integration, write more tests, refactor my code, learn more
frameworks and learn them more deeply, write more idiomatic code,
improve performance and security, get better at designing&#x2026; I find
it difficult to pay someone to give me feedback and coach me through
setting things up well (hard to evaluate people, anxious side balks
at the price and argues we can figure things out on our own, good
programmers have high rates), but this might be something we can
swap. Or I could work on overriding my anxious side and just Go For
It, because good habits and infrastructure pay off.
</li>

<li><b>Writing:</b> Comments, questions, and links help a lot. A few of my
posts have really benefited from people's feedback on the content
and the structure of ideas, and I'd love to learn from more
conversations like that. I don't worry a lot about typos or minor
tweaks, so the kind of editing feedback I can easily get from
freelancers doesn't satisfy me. I want to get better at writing for
other people and organizing more complex thoughts into resources, so
I could benefit a lot from feedback, questions, as well as advice on
what to learn and in what order.
</li>

<li><b>Drawing:</b> I'm not focused on drawing better (I can probably get
away with stick figures for what I want to do!), but rather on being
able to think more interesting thoughts. What would help with this?
Hearing from people about which thoughts spark ideas in them, which
ones I should flesh out further. Book recommendations and shared
experiences would help too.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So: Paying for free/pay-what-you-want-resources is great at helping me
tell my anxious side, "Look, people find this valuable," and that's
<b>much</b> appreciated. But giving me time works too. If we can figure out
how to do this well, that might be able to help me grow more (at least
until I sort out a way to talk my anxious side into letting me invest
more in capabilities). Shifting the balance towards time is probably
going to make my anxious side <b>more</b> anxious, but I might be able to
tell it to give me a year or two to experiment, which is
coincidentally the rest of this 5-year span.
</p>

<p>
Wild success might look like:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thanks to people's gifts of time and attention, I'm learning and
doing stuff that I couldn't do on my own or with the resources I
could get in marketplaces
</li>
<li>Thanks to people's gifts of money (and maybe teaching), I've
addressed more of my anxious side's concerns and am getting better
at experimenting with the resources I <i>can</i> get in marketplaces
</li>
<li>I can incorporate people's feedback and revealed preferences in my
prioritization so that I work on things that other people find
valuable
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I could use your help with this. =) Shall we figure it out together?

<p>
Following up on an interview, a journalist asked:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If I were to say that you freelance as [blank] consultant, what would be the word that fills that blank?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16091691968/">2015-01-14 Filling in the occupational blanks &#x2013; index card #experiment #occupation</a>
</p>

<p>
Tricky question. "Freelance" is definitely the wrong word for it,
since I doubt I'll be taking on any more clients and the word obscures
my current fascination with a self-directed life. It might make sense
to use the word "independent" if we really need to contrast this with
stable employment.
</p>

<p>
Technically, I spend a fraction of my time consulting, and I can
define the kind of consulting that I do in a compact phrase. But based
on my <a href="http://quantifiedawesome.com/time/review?utf8=%E2%9C%93&start=2014-01-01&end=2015-01-01&parent_id=&category_tree=full&display_type=percentage&zoom_level=&commit=Filter">2014 numbers</a>, that's only 12% of my time. This is much less than
the 37% of the time I spend sleeping, or even the 18% of the time I
spend on discretionary projects or the 15% of the time I spend taking
care of myself (not including the 7% of the time I spend on chores,
errands, and other things).
</p>

<p>
Since no one gets introduced as a sleeper even though that's what we
mostly do with our lives, maybe my discretionary projects will yield a
neat occupational description for people who <i>need</i> to have that
introductory phrase.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Am I a writer (3%)? ("Author" is a smidge more self-directed and
respectable, maybe, but I still don't feel like I've written Real
Books since all my resources are compilations of blog posts). A
blogger? This is a category so large, it could mean anything.
</li>
<li>A sketchnoter (3%)? Alternatively: a sketchnote artist or a doodler,
depending on whether I'm making it sound more respectable or more
approachable. But the popular understanding of sketchnotes (if there
is one) is that of recording other people's thoughts, and I'm
focusing on exploring my own questions.
</li>
<li>An Emacs geek (2%)? Too obscure; it doesn't provide useful
information for most people. Maybe an open source developer, which
also includes the 1% of the time I spend coding &#x2013; but I do more
writing <b>about</b> software than writing actual software or
contributing to projects. An open source advocate? But I don't push
it on people or try to change people's minds.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the rare meetups I go to, I usually mention a bunch of my interests
(drawing, writing, coding, experimenting), and people pick whatever
they're curious about. But most times, I try to preempt the "What do
<b>you</b> do?" question with something more interesting for me, like what
people are learning about or interested in. It's so much easier when
someone recognizes me from my blog, because then we can jump straight
to the interests we have in common.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, I come across people who persistently ask, "But
what do you <b>do</b>? What's your day job?" I confess it's a bit fun to
tweak the box they want to put me in. One approach I've heard other
people use is to playfully acknowledge the difficulty of
categorization. "On Mondays, I <span class="underline">_</span>. On Tuesdays, I <span class="underline">_</span>. On Wednesdays,
I___. &#x2026;" Others gleefully embrace descriptions like "I'm
unemployed."
</p>

<p>
But I'm missing the purpose of that introductory phrase or that short
bio here. It's not about shaking up the other person's worldview. At
its best, that occupational association helps the listener or reader
quickly grasp an idea of the other person's life and where the other
person is coming from. An accountant probably has a different way of
looking at things than a primary school teacher does. One's occupation
provides the other person with the ability to contextualize what one
says ("Oh, of course she thinks of things as systems and processes;
she works with code all day."). During small talk, it gives people
easy things to talk about while they're waiting for a more interesting
topic of conversation to appear: "What kinds of things do you write?"
</p>

<p>
Let's say, then, that my goals for this phrase would be:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to help people understand my context quickly, and how that might differ from their perspective
</li>
<li>to make the other person more comfortable by:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>being able to associate me with a stereotype that adds
information, possibly fleshing out this mental profile with
differences later on
</li>
<li>in conversation, letting them easily think of questions to ask,
addressing the <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/">phatic nature</a> of small talk (we're not actually
<b>talking</b>, we're making polite noises)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to branch off into more interesting conversations, avoiding the
dead-end that often comes up after the ritualistic exchange of "What
do you do?"
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of these goals, I like the third (interesting conversations) the most.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few of my options:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can accept convention and pick one aspect of what I do, especially
if I tailor it to their interests. For example, at a business event,
I might introduce myself as a social business consultant who helps
really large companies improve internal collaboration through
analytics and custom development for enterprise social network
platforms (well, isn't <b>that</b> a mouthful). At visual thinking
events, I might introduce myself as a sketchnoter focusing on
exploring my own ideas.
</li>
<li>I can waffle by introducing several aspects, still within the
vocabulary of regular occupations: a consultant and a writer, for
example.
</li>
<li>I can say, "It's complicated!" and explain my 5-year experiment,
self-directed living, and learning/coding/writing/drawing/sharing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Anyway, circling back to this writer and his likely use of some kind
of occupation as a way to introduce and contextualize me:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It might be interesting to play with <b>no</b> occupational
categorization. Some context may be provided by age (31) - it's
common enough in newspapers and books. The editor might send it back
with a question, "Yes, but what does she do?", but there it is.
</li>
<li>It might also be interesting to play with my difficulty of
categorization. "Sacha Chua, who couldn't come up with a single
phrase to describe her occupation, &#x2026;"
</li>
<li>Or, since it's no skin off my back if this is not fully
representative, I could just let him write whatever he wants to
write. Freelance consultant. Blogger. Sketchnoter. Amateur
experimenter. Independent developer. "Consultant" is a very small
part of my identity, actually, so developer or blogger might be
interesting. A possible missed opportunity here is that the wrong
frame might result in people not being able to identify with and
learn from stuff ("Of course she can deal with this, she's a coder";
"Bah, another blogger, is that all she does?"; "Why should I listen
to her? Freelance is just a fancy word for unemployed."). But it'll
do under time pressure. =)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm writing this on January 14 and posting this in the future (because
I limit posts to one a day), so the article will likely be out by now.
If I remember, I'll update this with what he actually used. =) But I
needed to think about it out loud, and I'm sure the situation will
come up again in the future. Perhaps by then I'll have a more compact
way to describe myself.
</p>

<p>
Since other people have figured this out before, I can learn from
them. (And possibly from you!) After all, I'm nowhere near as
interesting as Benjamin Franklin or Leonardo da Vinci, and somehow
<b>they</b> managed to settle down into a sequence of nouns. Here's the one
from Wikipedia's entry for Leonardo da Vinci:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an
Italian painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician,
engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and
writer.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
People can pick whatever aspect they want. I am multi-faceted and
growing. =)

<p>
My <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/2014-review/">annual review</a> showed me that despite my resolution to reduce
consulting and <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/becoming-own-client/">focus more on my own stuff</a> in 2014, I actually
increased the amount of time I spent working on client projects than I
did in 2013 (12% vs 9%). Sure, I increased the amount of time I
invested in my own productive projects (15% of 2014 compared to 14%
in 2013) and the balance is still tilted towards my own projects, but
I'd underestimated how much consulting pulls on my brain.
</p>

<p>
This is the fourth year of my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/experiment/">5-year experiment</a>, and I'm slowly coming
to understand the questions I want to ask. In the beginning, I wanted to know:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do I have marketable skills?
</li>
<li>Can I find clients?
</li>
<li>Can I build a viable business?
</li>
<li>Can I get the hang of accounting and paperwork?
</li>
<li>Can I manage cash flow?
</li>
<li>Can I work with other people?
</li>
<li>Can I deal with uncertainty and other aspects of this lifestyle?
</li>
<li>Can I manage my own time, energy, and opportunity pipeline?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm reasonably certain that I can answer all these questions with
"Yes." I've reduced the anxiety I used to have around those topics.
Now I'm curious about <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/09/planning-ahead-experiments/">other questions</a> I can explore during the
remainder of this experiment or in a new one.
</p>

<p>
In particular, this experiment gives me an rare opportunity to explore
this question: <b>Can I come up with good ideas and implement them?</b>
</p>

<p>
I'm fascinated by this question because I can feel the weakening pull
of other people's requests. It's almost like a space probe approaching
escape velocity, and then out to where propulsion meets little
resistance and there are many new things to discover.
</p>

<p>
The most worthwhile thing I'm learning from this experiment, I think,
is to sit with myself until the urge to work on other people's project
passes.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16204940041/">2015.01.05 Developing my imagination and initiative &#x2013; index card</a>
</p>

<p>
I found it easy and satisfying to work on other people's requests, and
harder to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/work-self-work/">figure out what <i>I</i> wanted to do</a>. It's like the way it's
easier to take a course than it is to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/getting-better-learning/">figure things out on your own</a>,
but learning on your own helps you figure out things that people can't
teach you.
</p>

<p>
What's difficult about figuring out what I want to do and doing it? I
think it involves a set of skills I need to develop. As a beginner,
I'm not very good, so I feel dissatisfied with my choices and more
inclined towards existing projects or requests that appeal to me. This
is not bad. It helps me develop other skills, like coding or testing.
Choosing existing projects often results in quick rewards instead of
an unclear opportunity cost. It's logical to focus on other people's
work.
</p>

<p>
One possibility is to build skills on other people's projects until I
run into an idea that refuses to let go of me, which is a practical
approach and the story of many people's businesses. The danger is that
I might get too used to working on other people's projects and never
try to come up with something on my own. In the grand scheme of
things, this is no big loss for the world (it'll probably be all the
same given a few thousand years), but I'm still curious about the
alternatives.
</p>

<p>
The other approach (which I'm taking with this experiment) is to make
myself try things out, learning from the experience and the
consequences. If I'm patient with my mediocrity, I might be able to
climb up that learning curve. I can figure out how to imagine and make
something new - perhaps even something that only I can do, or that
might not occur to other people, or that might not have an immediate
market. Instead of always following, I might sometimes be an artist or
even a leader.
</p>

<p>
<b>What would the ideal outcome be?</b> I would get to the point where I
can confidently combine listening to people and coming up with my own
ideas to create things that people want (or maybe didn't even know
they wanted).
</p>

<p>
<b>How can I tell if I'm succeeding?</b> Well, if people are giving me lots
of time and/or money, that's a great sign. It's not the only measure.
There's probably something along the lines of self-satisfaction. I
might learn something from, say, artists who lived obscure lives. But
making stuff that other people find remarkable and useful is probably
an indicator that I'm doing all right.
</p>

<p>
<b>What would getting this wrong be like? Well, it might turn out that
the opportunity cost of these experiments is too high</b>. For example,
if something happened to W-, our savings are running low, and I
haven't gotten the hang of creating and earning value, then I would
probably focus instead on being a really good follower. It's easy to
recognize this situation. I just need to keep an eye on our finances.
</p>

<p>
<b>It might also turn out that I'm not particularly original</b>, it would
take me ages to figure out how to be original in a worthwhile way, and
that it would be better for me to focus on contributing to other
people's projects. This is a little harder to distinguish from the
situation where I'm still slowly working my way up the learning curve.
This reminds me of Seth Godin's book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dip">The Dip</a>, only it's less about
dips and more about plateaus. It also reminds me of Scott H. Young's
post about <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2014/12/15/different-difficulty/">different kinds of difficulty</a>.
</p>

<p>
As a counterpoint to the scenario where I find out that I'm not
usefully original and that I'm better off mostly working on other
people's things, I hold up:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>my Emacs geekery, which people appreciate for both its weirdness and
their ability to pick out useful ideas from it
</li>
<li>the occasional mentions in books other people have written, where
something I do is used to illustrate an interesting alternative
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So I think it is likely that I can come up with good, useful ideas
<i>and</i> I can make them happen. Knowing that it's easy to get
dissatisfied with my attempts if I compare them with other things I
could be working on, I can simply ignore that discomfort and keep
deliberately practising until either I've gotten the hang of it or
I've put in enough effort and must conclude that other things are more
worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself considering the same kind of experiment with
freedom, deciding between other people's work and your own projects,
here's what I'm learning:
</p>

<p>

Someone asked:

One issue I have is prioritization. I sometimes find myself spending a

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>How much time do you actually have?</b>
</p>

<p>
It's easy to feel that most of your time is taken up with trivial
things. There's taking care of yourself and the household. There are
endless tasks to check off to-do lists. There's paperwork and
overhead.
</p>

<p>
I track my time, so I <i>know</i> I spend a lot of my time on the general
running of things. November was weird, so let me analyze October 2014
instead. A quick summary from my time-tracking gives me these numbers.
Out of the 744 hours in October, I used:
</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Assuming that my consulting, writing, and working on Emacs are the
activities that have some impact on the wider world, that's 144 hours
out of 744, or about 19% of all the time I have. This is roughly 4.5
hours a day. (And that's a generous assumption - many of the things I
write are personal reflections of uncertain value to other people.)
</p>

<p>
Even with tons of control over my schedule, I also spend lots of
time on low-impact activities.
</p>

<p>
And this is okay. I'm fine with that. I don't need to turn into a
value-creating machine entirely devoted to the pursuit of one clear
goal. I don't think I even can. It works for other people, but not for
me. I like the time I spend cooking and helping out around the house.
I like the time I spend playing with interesting ideas. I like the
pace I keep.
</p>

<p>
So I'm going to start with the assumption that <b>this is the time that
I can work with</b> instead of being frustrated with the other things
that fill my life. This is different from the mindset that I find in
many productivity and time management books, I think, where the rest
of your life is often treated as something that gets in the way of
your Real Work. (Are you kidding? The time that I spend snuggling with
W- or the cats - that's Real Life right there, for me, and I'm often
all too aware of how short life is.) This low-impact stuff is what
grounds me and makes me human.
</p>

<p>
<b>Preparing</b>
</p>

<p>
And when I'm alert and I have the time to dig into something deeply?
(Which I often do, since I keep my schedule relatively uncluttered by
commitments.) Then I want to have stuff ready to work on and ideas to
explore. That way, <b>I can work on whatever I feel like working on.</b>
Why waste energy fighting yourself and forcing yourself to work on one
important thing, when you can choose from <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/03/reflecting-goals-time/">a buffet of good options</a>?
(March 2014)
</p>

<p>
This sounds like a recipe for procrastination, an easy way for
near-term pleasurable tasks to crowd out important but tedious ones.
</p>

<p>
<b>But I also ask myself:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Why do I feel like doing various things?</b> Is there an underlying
cause or unmet need that I can address? Am I avoiding something
because I don't understand it or myself well enough? Do I only think
that I want something, or do I really want it? I do a lot of this
thinking and planning throughout my life, so that when those awesome
hours come when everything's lined up and I'm ready to make
something, I can just go and do it.
</li>
<li><b>Can I tweak how I feel about things</b> by emphasizing positive
aspects or de-emphasizing negative ones? What can I enjoy about the
things that are good for me? What can I dislike about the things
that are bad for me?
</li>
<li><b>What can I do now to make things better later?</b> How can I take
advantage of those moments when I'm focused and everything comes
together? How can I make better use of normal moments? How can I
make better use of the gray times too, when I'm feeling bleah?
</li>
<li><b>How can I slowly accumulate value?</b> How can I scale up by making
things available?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I don't really work with a grand vision or a sense of importance. I
don't need to make big jumps. I'm delighted (and somewhat mystified)
when other people tell me that they found my blog posts or resources
useful. Even if I proceed at my current pace&#x2013;for example,
accumulating a blog post a day&#x2013;in twenty years, I'll probably be
somewhere interesting.
</p>

<p>
What that usually works out to is that I use my time to learn
something, writing and drawing along the way. I've been blogging for
the past twelve years or so. It's incredible how those notes have
helped me remember things, and how even the little things I learn can
turn out to be surprisingly useful.
</p>

<p>
I might never do anything Important Enough to show up in the history
books or get a Wikipedia page. But hey, if I help people save a little
time, tickle their brains, or help them learn stuff, maybe they will.
=)
</p>

<p>
And I'm really curious about what, say, learning out loud for 50 years
can tell us. I love reading about how people kept journals and
commonplace books of the things they learn, but what we can do now is
so different from those personal notes back then. Now we can open up
our notes for other people to search or learn from or be inspired by.
Now we have conversations that grow out of notes we've forgotten
writing. So maybe that's the Important Thing that I'm working on, but
I won't know what the results are like until decades have passed.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. I think how I deal with prioritization is to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Embrace your limits.</b> Don't stress out about not being 100%
productive or dedicated. Accept that there will be times when you're
distracted or sick, and there will be times when you're focused and
you can do lots of good stuff. Accepting this still lets you tweak
your limits, but you can do that with a spirit of loving kindness
instead of frustration.
</li>
<li><b>Understand yourself and play with what you think about things.</b>
Instead of fighting motivation head-on, approach it sideways by
asking questions and choosing what to focus your awareness on.
</li>
<li><b>Prepare.</b> You can get a decent amount done normally, and sometimes
you can get a lot more done because you have a lot more energy or
concentration. Even when you don't feel on top of the game, you can
prepare so that you can make the most of the moments when you do
(and get some things done even when you don't). For a writer, that
might mean keeping lots of outlines and ideas around. For a
developer, that might mean reading documentation and sketching out
plans. There's so much you can do to lay the groundwork.
</li>
<li><b>Accumulate gradual progress.</b> Sometimes you only <i>feel</i> like you're
not making any progress because you don't see how far you've come.
Your memory is fuzzy and will lie to you. Take notes. Better yet,
share those notes. Then you can see how your journey of a thousand
miles is made up of all those little steps you've been taking - and
you might even be able to help out or connect with other people
along the way.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hope that helps!

<p>
Following up on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/figuring-temporary-sleep-schedule-interacts-programming-writing-drawing/">a previous reflection about working within my current
constraints</a>, I was thinking about multiple models of awesomeness.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's the 10X Hero Programmer idea of someone who can brilliantly
cut through the clutter and write just the code that's needed to
solve the problem you didn't know you had. Awesomeness might involve
being able to perceive the true need, bring together different
components, and create something solid.
</li>
<li>There are architects and team enablers who can work within
organizations (both formal and informal) to make bigger things
happen. Awesomeness might involve balancing multiple trade-offs, keeping
track of complex structures, and using soft skills to get stuff
done.
</li>
<li>There are people who envision products and services, bringing them
to the people who need them. They might create things themselves, or
they might invest in forming a team to create things.
</li>
<li>There are people who create bridges for other people so that they
can get started or they can develop their skills. Awesomeness might
involve presenting things in a clear, logical, inspiring, and useful
manner. Plenty of role models doing cool stuff in this area, and
lots of ways to grow.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh, that's interesting. That makes sense to me. I can see myself
growing into that last one. It fits the things that tickle my brain.
</p>

<p>
I don't have to worry about doing Clever Things or Big Things. As I
get better at doing what I already enjoy doing, sharing what I'm
learning and helping other people along the way, I'll find my own path
to awesomeness.

<p>
"The question I really want to answer is: How can I live a fuller
life, a happier life, a more productive life?" said someone in a
recent e-mail about Quantified Self.
</p>

<p>
This made me think: The ideal life differs from person to person.
*What kind of awesome life am I moving towards? What motivates my
choices and experiments, and how can I explore and learn more
effectively?*
</p>

<p>
I have role models for this, so I can imagine what it looks like. I
can look at the differences between our lives to get a better
understanding of the gaps and divergences.
</p>

<p>
My parents have full, happy, productive, and significant lives
(although I think my mom thinks that what she's doing isn't as awesome
or as significant as what my dad does). They make things happen. In
particular, my dad touches lots of people's lives. He has this really
big scope.
</p>

<p>
W- lives a full, happy, productive life. I think he focuses on doing a
good job at work, doing the right thing, knowing (and applying!) all
sorts of good knowledge, and being a great husband and dad. We're
probably not going to get added to any tribal epics or history books,
but that's okay. I tend to think of his scope as smaller, more local,
and he's totally awesome within it. He sometimes reaches beyond that
scope to support interesting things, like Kickstarters for
well-designed products.
</p>

<p>
I think I live a decently full, happy, and productive life as well.
Definitely yes to the happy bit; yay for high genetic set-points for
happiness, good coping mechanisms, and a tremendous amount of luck. I
keep some slack in my life, so I don't feel like it's super-full or
super-productive. But people tell me that I do a lot, so maybe this is
like the way my mom's not as sure about her own contributions. I could
probably do more, but this is as good a start as any.
</p>

<p>
My scope tends to be similar to W-'s, focusing on our little world.
But I also have these odd outgrowths for things like Emacs, visual
thinking, social business, Hacklab&#x2026; These aren't as driven as my
dad's initiatives or my friends' startups. They're more&#x2026;
curiosity-based, maybe? I enjoy exploring those playgrounds and
sharing what I'm learning. I think W- is like this too - he follows
his curiosity into new areas.
</p>

<p>
So, if that helps me understand a little of who I am now, what does
that tell me about the future Sacha I'm gradually inching towards, and
what experiments can help me learn more?
</p>

<p>
I imagine Awesome Sacha to be this capable, curious person with lots
of skills, including practical DIY stuff. Her equanimity and optimism
lets her handle whatever life throws at her (and learn from it!).
Maybe she's more involved in the community now, helping her favourite
causes, but probably more from a position of lifting people up rather
than going on crusades. She takes plenty of notes and shares them,
helping other people learn faster and see the connections among
different ideas.
</p>

<p>
If that's a potentially interesting Future Sacha I could become, what
can I track to measure my progress along the way, and what kinds of
experiments could stretch me a little bit more towards that?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>I can pick up and practise more skills:</b> Cooking, sewing,
electronics, DIY repair, etc. I can track this through journal
entries, blog posts, comfort level, and decisions to do things
myself versus asking or paying someone else to do things. For
example, I now feel comfortable cooking, and I remember feeling a
lot more uncertain about it before. I feel moderately okay about
repairing small appliances and doing simple woodworking, but could
use more practice. I have hardly any experience with plumbing or
tiling.
</li>
<li><b>I can observe more, and write about more of what I'm learning:</b> The
little hiccups and challenges in my life feel so much smaller than
the ones that other people go through, and I usually don't write
about them. Keeping a journal (even for the small stuff) might
result in interesting reading later on, though. I already bounce
back pretty quickly. It might be interesting to see how I respond to
larger and larger changes, though, so deliberately taking on more
commitments and more risks can help me develop this part of my life.
</li>
<li><b>I can help out more.</b> I think it's okay even if I don't try to
maximize utility on this for now. I'll start with the things that
resonate with me. It's easy enough to track hours and money for
this; maybe later I can add stories too.
</li>
<li><b>I can get better at taking, organizing, and sharing my notes.</b> I
can see the gap in my note-taking by noticing when I'm annoyed that
I can't find my old notes (either because I hadn't written them up
properly or I didn't make them findable enough). As for organizing
and sharing my notes, perhaps I can track the number of longer
guides I put together, and whether I can get the hang of working
with outlines and pipelines&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most of my little experiments come from looking at ideas that are
close by and saying, "Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe I can explore
that." Sometimes it helps to look a little further ahead&#x2013;to sketch
out an ideal life, or even just a slightly-better-than-this life&#x2013;and
to plan little steps forward, going roughly in the right direction.
Some ideals fit you better than others do, and some ideals just won't
resonate with you. For example, I currently don't wish to be a
highly-paid jetsetting public speaker. Thinking about this helps you
figure out what kind of future you might want, and maybe figure out a
few ways to try it on for size and track your progress as you grow
into it.
</p>

<p>
What kind of person would Awesome You be like, and how can you inch a little closer?

Two of my friends were hanging out at a park, so I decided to join
them. It was a leisurely afternoon of sunshine, idle conversation, and ice
cream. In the evening, we watched a movie&#x2013;which turned out to be free
because of projector issues.
</p>

<p>
Come to think of it, I rarely choose a pace as slow as that, but
sometimes I enjoy it. Weekends, we do chores and get ready for the
next week, with some time for reading and writing and other interests.
During my non-consulting weekdays, I'm often writing or learning or
trying something new. Even the long walks I occasionally take feel a
little purposeful.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the time I spend with W- is like that, like when we go for
bike rides or movies or dinner. Most of the times, we relax through
activity.
</p>

<p>
With friends, I tend towards slow time rather than active time. But I
catch myself being occasionally hesitant about spending time with
other people, because sometimes I want to be fast instead of slow, or
I want to do something else, and I'm not sure if people will take it
the wrong way.

Anyway, when things line up, that feels good.

<p>
In <i>Creating a Good Life: Applying Aristotle's Wisdom to Find Meaning and Happiness</i> (O'Toole and Isaacson, 2005), the authors suggest the following questions for reflection:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To what extent do I behave in intemperate ways?
</li>
<li>How can I build the habits of temperance and right desire?
</li>
<li>What activities do I currently find pleasurable, but which prevent me from becoming happy in the long term?
</li>
<li>What activity do I engage in with others that gives me so much pleasure that I lose my intemperate desires in the process?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have time data going back to November 2011. This helps me review my day objectively, seeing the times when
</p>

<p>
What activities do I engage in for short-term benefits, but which
might be taking time away from other things I could do for my
long-term happiness if I let them run away with me?
</p>


<p>
What else am I sometimes intemperate in? I sleep a lot - about 8.6
hours a day, and not always because I need it. Sometimes I stay in bed
mentally running through different scenarios. It's still within the
healthy range, though.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I have bursts of watching videos or reading comics.

<p>
Aristotle splits up leisure into amusement (passive entertainment), recreation (active exertion), and contemplation (building understanding).

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

<li>I try to stay close to what I know or can help with instead of building up skills during client time. So, yes to troubleshooting or looking up
API details, but no to longer-term improvements such as going through web design courses. (I can do that on my own time.) If I invest time in
building those skills, then I'll feel all right doing more work.
</li>
<li>I say yes to work when my teammates need help with their workload. I'm okay with weekends and holidays because I get plenty of discretionary
time during the week. This probably means I can take on more work if my teammates feel overloaded, if they think it's good value. (Happiness
is worth it.)

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Save more:</b> make our safety buffer bigger, start working on W-'s retirement. Easy path.
</li>
<li><b>Live more:</b> replace activities we don't particularly like doing with more discretionary time, or add more relaxation/life stuff (massages)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most of my tasks give me personal benefit, and I don't want to get used to lifestyle inflation
</li>
<li>It feels wasteful to pay for chores (ex: washing the dishes, cooking food), especially as I get a lot of enjoyment out of those activities
too (washing dishes = creative downtime, cooking food = family)
</li>
<li>Not likely to pursue this path
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Earn more:</b> replace activities we don't particularly like doing with more work time
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I earn more than I would pay someone for the tasks I would replace
</li>
<li>If I could, say, work one hour and hire out or accelerate three hours (net gain of two hours)
</li>
<li>but my limiting factor isn't really time, and the things I want to invest in don't have an immediate time=money result, so it blends into the next category&#x2026;
</li>

</li>
<li><b>Learn more:</b> replace activities with more learning and making
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do I get more value out of building those life skills now instead of earning money to buy the time later?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Three steps: work more, delegate more, and then fill that time with something productive
</li>
<li>versus working less (or the same) and directly filling the time with something productive
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>comparative advantage if
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>working more lets me give myself permission to invest in more tools and education, speeding up learning/doing by 2-3x
</li>
<li>working 1 hour lets me free up 2-3 hours with minimal admin overhead.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually, I would want to bank at least half of any extra. So I should make a business plan that looks for twice the ROI.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oh, there's an idea there&#x2026; Maybe I should make a "business plan" for my learning, and identify where I can accelerate it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would I invest in specifics?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What are the activities I could reduce?</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Grocery shopping and library errands - revisit my online grocery shopping experiment?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Social time with W-
</li>
<li>15% premium for 1 hour per week; time spent shopping online, so maybe 45 min saved per week?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Litter-box cleaning: ~15min/day. Tried paying J- to do it, but offer not motivating enough for her. Doesn't make sense to have someone else come in and do it. Should take on other chores to offset&#x2026;
</li>
<li>Weekly laundry: pretty easy. Social time with W-, and watching movies.
</li>
<li>Weekly or bi-weekly cleaning
</li>
<li>Offset some of W-'s activities, such as working on the deck?
</li>
<li>Video games?
</li>
<li>Actually, my life is pretty trim
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>What are the activities I could invest in?</b> TODO Post this as a quick question - what would people like me to invest more into?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Writing:</b> Buy recent books instead of relying on the library. Give stuff away. Invest time in formatting, or pay someone to format. Interview people and send them gift certificates. Go for a course. Get a coach. Experiment with writing topic-focused blogs and delegation. Buy premium plugins or themes. Pay a designer, coder, editor, or social media person. Get things transcribed. Learn how to work with writers?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Platform University? Copyblogger? ProBlogger Academy? Firepole Marketing?
</li>
<li>Let's say that I want writing to become a larger stream of income. What would I need to do?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Plan content
</li>
<li>Reach out to people (bloggers, potential community)
</li>
<li>Create, organize, and format content
</li>
<li>Put content up for sale
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Drawing:</b> Get and learn how to use Illustrator, maybe once we've got a Windows desktop set up. Learn 3D modeling, buy models. Learn animation, buy tools.
</li>
<li><b>Coding:</b> Buy premium plugins, scripts or themes. Experiment with digital delivery systems when Gumroad volume gets large enough. Have someone I can send technical questions to with payment or gifts of appreciation? Maybe indirectly through my blog - send more gift certificates?
</li>
<li><b>Connecting:</b> Treat people to food (either at home or outside) - maybe outside so that I don't feel self-conscious about home. Visit family and friends in the Philippines. (Don't want to trade off time with W-, though.) Learn how to make or buy gifts. Buy stamps. Buy ingredients and make HackLab dinners. Schedule more get-togethers with people.
</li>
<li><b>Making:</b> Take a class (cooking, sewing, home maintenance)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take a cooking class? I can buy a lot of ingredients with that money.
</li>
<li>Sewing class? Took one. YouTube is amazing and convenient. Class interactivity wasn't that compelling. Other people have learned this before, and I can too.
</li>
<li>Home maintenance skills? Checking for workshops
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Fitness:</b> Sign up for classes. Rotate through classes/gyms a month at a time until I find something I love. Make biking in winter safer and more comfortable.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's easier to think of investing time rather than money. I've got lots of ideas for investing time.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So maybe it makes sense to keep my surplus as time instead of converting it into money&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What's another approach?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep my unpaid work and earning time the same
</li>
<li>Plan for a reduction in earning time, so I know what activities will take the surplus time and I can direct it instead of frittering it away
</li>
<li>Minimize external commitments; refer work to other people instead of taking on time=money trades
</li>
<li>Force myself to double-down on creating content that's useful for other people
</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reinvesting needs to beat what I can get elsewhere. Good test: profit, inexpensive test, greater return of profit.

</p>

<p>
Decisions
</p>
</li>
<li>I'll probably step up consulting a little because things are working well. Maybe 2.5 days a week instead of 2, maybe
even 3 if the balance keeps and the budget holds.
</li>
<li>I'll refer other time=money swaps to people, doing only what I need to do. This builds a network of skills.
</li>
<li>I'll save surplus money instead of making myself use it.
</li>
<li>As consulting winds down, I'll assign the surplus time to creating content, getting really good at writing and drawing and reaching out.
</li>
<li>I'll start "banking" evergreen posts until I reach enough that it makes sense to create a topic-focused blog. This gets around my worry that it will be a stale one. Maybe 12, 26, or 52? Likely candidates: sketchnoting, blogging, personal finance.
</li>
<li>I <b>won't</b> throw money at the problem. I'll pretend that I'm bootstrapping content. I'll use my opportunity fund for small experiments or good wins, gradually scaling it up.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I predict that these decisions will:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Give me a comfortable safety buffer
</li>
<li>Keep me hungry and creative instead of letting me make lazy decisions about tools or delegation
</li>
<li>Limit my growth a little, but keep it manageable

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-401">
<p>
<b>People sometimes get the impression that I'm this super-busy, super-productive person. I'm not.</b> Thanks to this experiment with semi-retirement, I'm probably the least busy person I know, at least in terms of people less than 60 years old. I try to get one or two good things done each day. The difference, I suppose, is that I write about it, so the days don't blur together and I can actually tell you where the time went.
</p>

<p>
I try hard to not be busy. I minimize the number of commitments I make. I still occasionally turn down invitations or requests, but I'm up front about my reasons. It's not that I'm busy, I've just got other priorities. It's not that I'm busy, it's that I'm tired and want to sleep in. It's not that I'm busy, it's that I don't feel up to it right now. (Introvert mode strikes again.) It's not that I'm busy, I just want to keep the time open so I can follow where my interests lead me.
</p>



<p>
There are two types of balance that I pay attention to. One is my bank balance, of course. As long as it remains comfortably high, I'm okay.
</p>

<p>
The other balance, the more important one, is the balance of how W-
feels about this experiment. He works long hours, although he's also
got great work-life balance and enjoys the occasional walk to the
library while his code compiles.
</p>

<p>
I work more than I estimated I needed. I'm keeping the same frugal lifestyle, but the excess can go towards our safety buffer and possibly his early retirement too.
</p>


<p>
Sometimes I give myself permission to play video games most of the
afternoon, after learning interesting things and writing several blog
posts along the way.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-403">
<p>
This is probably the hardest part of semi-retirement: learning how to
be. Learning to let go of the need to check things off a list or do
things that I consider productive. Learning how to ignore the clock
and follow the flow.
</p>

<p>
Look, I'm writing a blog post instead of staring off into space. This
time, I'm not starting with an outline. We'll just see where this post
goes.
</p>

<p>
It's not all "work." I sleep in, and I go for walks, and I get on my
bike and go to places even if I don't need to. I cook and I read and I
garden. I tidy. I play video games.
</p>

<p>
They're still all verbs. That's okay. The goal isn't to do <i>nothing</i>,
the goal is to be where I am: unhurried, present, not frustrated, not
judging myself for what I do or don't do.
</p>

<p>
Pretty good, actually.

<p>
I'm almost half-way through this 5-year experiment with
semi-retirement. Every so often, I like reflecting on the possible
outcomes and whether I want to influence things one way or another.
(Totally unscientific here!) Thinking about this will also help me
figure out what I need to try so that I can properly discriminate
among the options. Here are some of the ways this experiment could
work out.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A. "<b>I want to go back to a regular job.</b>" Let's say that at the end of
five years, I've learned what I want to learn to have a
smoothly-running, wonderful life, and I want to go back to working
within someone else's business so that I can take advantage of its
scale and infrastructure. I'd rebuild my network and dust off my
resume, likely working my way back into a technical position in a
team I enjoy working with. Life would be pretty similar to what life
was like at IBM, except perhaps I'd be fitter, cook better, and
write more.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Factors that would nudge me towards this:</b> Possible job
satisfaction, scale, learning experiences, team I like; also, if
W- downshifts to part-time or takes a break
</li>
<li><b>What would a typical week look like?</b> Work, cook, read, write. I
might use the extra cash to outsource chores or buy conveniences.
Hmm, danger of lifestyle inflation here?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B. "<b>I want to keep freelancing.</b>" Let's say that I like the
flexibility and usefulness that consulting a few days a week gives
me. I'd probably expand my consulting practice slightly so that I
don't have to worry about being classified as a personal services
business. During my free days, I might continue to do the kinds of
things I'm doing now: writing, learning, tinkering with stuff.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Factors that would nudge me towards this:</b> Happy clients,
continued growth; also, if W- downshifts to part-time
</li>
<li><b>What would a typical week look like?</b> Much like my current weeks,
but maybe consulting for different companies for a good balance.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C. "<b>I want to build a lifestyle business.</b>" This would be if I'm
curious about building other types of businesses. Maybe I'd learn
more about web marketing, for example. I'd still keep it low-key so
that I can do other things with the rest of my time.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Factors that would nudge me towards this:</b> Curiosity about
businesses that go beyond time-for-money exchanges; commitment to
make products or automated services
</li>
<li><b>What would a typical week look like?</b> Responding to people's
questions, creating new things, improving old stuff. Occasionally
learning new skills and trying them out.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D. "<b>I want to 'lean in' in terms of business.</b>" This would probably be
the next stage after building a small lifestyle business that's
focused on products or automated services. Assuming I've got the
rest of my life sorted out, I might channel my curiosity and energy
into building the business so that I can help more people and apply
what I've been learning from business books.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Factors that would nudge me towards this:</b> Finding a good market
that I really want to help
</li>
<li><b>What would a typical week look like?</b> I'd probably learn how to
manage a small team, do lots of research and customer service, and
make stuff happen.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>E. "<b>I probably don't have to work, at least for a while.</b>" Stock
market growth and savings might mean that I'll have lots of
flexibility, so I could choose to work or not. Depending on our
circumstances, I might decide to focus on building up skills, making
our lives easier, learning things, and sharing whatever I can. It'll
be an interesting challenge figuring things out. I'd like to get
really good at writing. I'd still be open to going back to work
(even in a non-tech job) if the market plummets or W- needs me to
cover things.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Factors that would nudge me towards this:</b> ~3% withdrawal rate,
good cash buffer for market corrections, productive things to do
with my time, questions to explore
</li>
<li><b>What would a typical week look like?</b> Read, write, garden,
exercise, cook. Occasionally get together with other people.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm the most curious about E (financial independence plus writing),
but C (lifestyle business) that might eventually transition to D
(larger business) could be interesting too.

</p>

<p>
People occasionally ask me what it would take for me to consider
stopping my experiment early and go back to full-time work. On
reflection, I think the answer is: unfortunate circumstances, depleted
savings, or other family needs. (I don't recommend setting me up for
this!)
</p>

<p>
It's a little odd realizing that I can't think of any positive things
that would tempt me away from this path for the next few years, not
even being offered another job tailored to my interests and skills. If
people offered a ridiculously high salary, I would question the sanity
and longevity of the company; if they offered a more reasonable one,
I'd pick the freedom and the flexibility of the experiment. We have
enough for our needs and few wants.

:Effort:   1:00
</p>

<p>
I have a few 8 AM meetings this week. I don't <i>really</i> have to go, but
I think it would be useful and good for the team, so I go and
contribute as much as I can. The downside is that my brain is fuzzy
the rest of the day, although a short nap or break is remarkably
restorative. I can nap easily when I'm at Hacklab. When I am with my
consulting client, napping is harder to arrange, so I typically head
home early.
</p>

<p>
I experimented with going to a breakfast meetup. I made it there early
and was alert enough to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/14605456916/">take notes</a>, but found myself mentally drifting
afterwards. I read some nonfiction, then idled a while reading blogs,
and then finally gave in to my better judgment and took a half-hour
nap. Post-nap I can read and understand bigger thoughts, and now I can
write.
</p>

<p>
I find that having less than eight hours of sleep the night before
generally leads to this sort of fuzziness, which could be avoided,
perhaps, if I just went to bed earlier. Despite efforts, somehow the
rhythms of our household life lead to me going to bed some time
between 11:30 PM and 12:30 PM unless I am very tired. (Otherwise, if I
go to bed too early, I often end up fidgeting.) I get up between 8 to
9 AM, sometimes even 10 or 11. The morning's routines take me an hour,
which means I can have brunch, then settle in for a few hours of
writing or reading. The occasional early morning is easier to
accommodate as a one-off than to shift my routines earlier in general.
</p>

<h4 id="unnumbered-414"><a id="o2b:fd67833d-76f2-4def-ba9d-dd966a44c3bb"></a><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Reflections on Aristotle, ends, and leisure&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="tag"><span class="life">life</span>&#xa0;<span class="philosophy">philosophy</span></span></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-414">
<p>
What are the ends I pursue, and how do I pursue them?
</p>

<p>
I agree with Aristotle in that my ultimate end is happiness. For me,
happiness is more along the lines of equanimity or tranquility: being
able to appreciate the good parts and being confident that I can
weather the tough parts. From stoicism, I understand that things
aren't good or bad in themselves; it's more about my responses to
those things. So for me, a good life is one where I can respond as I
want to and as I should.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, what would that good life look like, and what are
the goals I want to strive towards?
</p>

<p>
One easy goal to plan for is a good financial foundation. It's easier
to act freely when you're not worried about food or shelter. I also
work on keeping frugal, moderate tastes and a detachment from things.
"It's just stuff," W- and I say as we drop things off for donation or
resist buying more things.
</p>

<p>
I value learning, too. I like feeling concepts click together,
learning how to build more complex things. I particularly like it when
I can use what I'm learning to save time, especially when I help other
people avoid repetitive, mechanical work.
</p>

<p>
I enjoy learning and working the most when I can create something
distinctive that takes advantage of an unusual combination of skills
or experiences. For example, I like the social business consulting
that I do because it's uncommon for people to be interested in large
organizations, collaboration, workflow, change management, data
visualization, programming, and design. I enjoy working on Emacs or on
self-tracking because both lend themselves well to idiosyncratic
questions and personal curiosities.
</p>

<p>
I've been self-consciously writing about leisure for what feels like
too many days now. I'm trying to figure out how I want to spend my
time, since that's a decision I'm going to make repeatedly over
decades. My answers will change over the years, too, but if I think
about it a little, I might be able to make better decisions.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, we think of relaxation and recreation as ways to
recharge ourselves so that we can get back to work with more energy.
Aristotle prizes the contemplative life, where you use your leisure
time not just to amuse yourself, but to improve.
</p>

<p>
What does that mean to me, though? For example, I could spend some
time learning languages, or developing my drawing skills, or picking
up a new technology. There's so much more to learn about all sorts of
other subjects. An easy answer to the question "What shall I do with
my time?" might be to volunteer, but I would also want to do that with
deliberation. What will help me grow, and what's just a nice-to-have?
</p>

<p>
Let's say that I don't know enough to choose those topics from the
beginning. How can I get better at observing myself and learning from
how I use my leisure time? What would make a difference when I look
back over a long life?
</p>

<p>
One of the things that has helped me a lot and that I'd like to get
very good at is the ability to notice (as the Less Wrong community
phrases it) that I am confused, and to explore that confusion. Reading
helps me notice the gaps and find words to describe things, and
writing helps me start to untangle the knots. If I keep getting better
at this, then when I'm much more experienced, I might be able to spot
opportunities for growth, catch myself before I make mistakes, and
also help friends think through their own lives.
</p>

<p>
Learning various skills (tech, DIY, cooking) helps improve my
self-efficacy. I can make more things myself, and I can imagine more
things too. Besides, it's fun, and occasionally economically useful.
</p>

<p>
I'm still not as keen on conversation and friendship as I probably
should be, at least according to Aristotle. I enjoy conversations with
W- most of all. I like the mix of practicality, growth, and whimsical
puns. On occasion, I enjoy conversations with other people, especially
those I think well of and want to support. Other times, I talk to
people for variety and social exercise. I'm comfortable with that
because I'm not trying to be popular, entertaining, or entertained. I
don't mind taking my time with the slow collection of interesting
people I can learn from and help.
</p>

<p>
I can use my leisure time to learn how to prefer things that are good
for me. For example, I'm working on that exercise habit. I'm sure that
once I've gotten into the swing of things, I'll be able to enjoy it -
I just have to stick it out until then. I have much to learn about
music, art, design, and literature, too.
</p>

<p>
I think a good life is one where I have the space, awareness, and
control to respond to life the way I want to, and that I've learned to
want what's good for me. I'd like to be able to say, looking back,
that I've deliberated on how I wanted to live and that I've lived
pretty darn close to what I decided. We'll just have to see how it all
works out!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-415">
<p>
How do I want to spend my leisure time? I've been thinking about that
a bit because we're halfway through a long weekend, and I have much
more discretionary time during the week than most people do.
</p>

<p>
W- and I are both homebodies. During normal weekends, we typically
spend a day focused on cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, and taking
care of other little things around the house. That still leaves some
time for walks, gardening, reading, writing, and watching the videos
that we borrow from the library. During long weekends, we usually take
advantage of the extra time and energy by working on household
projects or doing a deeper clean. W- tends to work long hours, so when
he's not busy with work or gym classes, I prefer to spend the time
with him instead of hanging out with other friends. Life is short,
after all.
</p>

<p>
I also have some time during the week, when most people are busy
working. I've been using that time to read, learn, exercise, and
explore. From time to time, I hang out with friends. Last Friday, two
of my friends were hanging out at a park, so I decided to join them.
It was a leisurely afternoon of sunshine, idle conversation, and ice
cream. In the evening, we watched a movie which turned out to be free
because of projector issues.
</p>

<p>
I'm not always keen on conversation, so I don't particularly like
scheduling things and I can be reluctant to meet up or chat. If I can
guiltlessly change plans - to wander in and out as I want - I feel
much better about it.
</p>

<p>
Then there's discretionary time when I'm alone, too. I usually spend
this reading, coding, writing, or drawing. I've been feeling a little
scattered lately. It's hard to latch onto a question and follow it.
Focusing on building habits around exercise and gardening seems to be
helping, and exploring recipes is fun too. Fortunately, there's a lot
to keep making slow progress on while cultivating curiosity&#x2026;

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-416" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="unnumbered-416"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Risk aversion</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-416">
<p>
I'm more careful about risks than I was at the beginning of this experiment. I see more negative consequences when projecting the results of decisions, and I perceive more volatility. I tend to overestimate the probability and impact of negative possibilities, and I'm conservative about taking advantage of opportunities.
</p>

<p>
This is interesting to me because I expected the opposite result when I started this experiment. A safety net should enable me to feel comfortable with taking more risks. In particular, I would probably have expected to take more risks in terms of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tools: get better at seeing the possible improvements or new capabilities opened up by tools
</li>
<li>Education: learn faster with other people's helps
</li>
<li>Networking: connect with and help more people
</li>
<li>Creation: make and ship more things
</li>
<li>Delegation: working with other people to get even more done
</li>
<li>Commitment, schedule: plan for larger things, and hustle in order to get more things done
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmm. Come to think of it, even my perception about increased risk aversion is perhaps inaccurate. Over the past two years, I've learned a lot from taking risks in terms of business models, sales, delegation, and so on. Let me take a closer look at the categories I mentioned to see if I can come up with counterpoints:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tools: Small hardware, software, and network upgrades have worked out well.
</li>
<li>Education: I've learned that I can learn a lot from books, experimentation, and connecting online, which is why paid courses and conferences haven't really been on my radar.
</li>
<li>Networking: The Emacs Chat podcast is a new thing for me, and I'm slowly getting the hang of it. I've been moving to getting to know people online instead of focusing on in-person connecting, and I like connecting with peers or people I can help rather than trying to connect with high-flying celebrities. I think I like the direction I'm going, actually.
</li>
<li>Creation: PDFs, guides, and e-mail courses are new for me. That's working well. Free/PWYW helps me reduce risk and avoid being anxious about satisfaction.
</li>
<li>Delegation: Not as good as I could be when it comes to assigning tasks, but still better than nothing.
</li>
<li>Commitment, schedule: This is probably where the biggest difference is. I'm less inclined to schedule things, and I try to minimize my commitments in terms of time and energy. Every so often, I think about whether I should be hustling more, but I like my current pace.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh, that's interesting. I think I'm surprised by the way I'm getting better at saying no, which is apparently a very useful skill. I'm getting better at not feeling guilty about it, too. I want to make sure I'm saying yes to some things, what I'm saying yes to is worth it for me, and that I'm not prematurely closing off things that do want.
</p>

<p>
How do I want to tweak this? I'd still probably minimize the number of commitments. I might take more notes on decisions. That would give me a better handle on risks that worked out well and risks that didn't, because what I recall is biased by my mood. What I take notes on is biased by mood as well, but it'll be easier to find contrary examples.
</p>

<p>
Also, when I find myself possibly overestimating the likelihood or impact of negative possibilities, I can sanity-check my perceptions with research and with other people. Hmm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
It's kinda fun noticing when your brain is acting a little weird. =) We'll see how I can work around things!

<p>
When I <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/02/experience-report-incorporating-a-federal-numbered-corporation-in-canada/">incorporated a company</a> for my experiments with semi-retirement, I chose a September 30 year-end following the advice of the Internet. (That way, you avoid the overcrowded post-Dec 31 scramble.)
</p>

<p>
It's the end of my second fiscal year. I thought I'd review my decisions for reinvesting profits, plan ahead, and ask for feedback. Here's how I reinvested some of my profits this year:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Tools and education</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I bought $289 worth of books, including pricey but useful books on drawing emotions and stick figures (Bikablo, from Neuland). I've made the most of them by reading, taking notes, and sharing what I've learned, so this was definitely worth it.
</li>
<li>I also took the <a href="http://alphachimpu.com/?ap_id=sachac">AlphaChimp Rockstar Scribe course</a> (CAD 298.66, it's now USD 497; affiliate link). I picked up a few tips on digitizing scanned sketches (lesson 6: digital documentation). The exercises also prompted me to put together my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/11/coming-up-with-a-three-word-life-philosophy/">3-word life philosophy</a> and my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/01/imagining-the-next-five-years-and-planning-2013/">5-year plan</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Connecting with people</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The biggest chunk here was flying to London for the Emacs Conference, which was a great way to connect with people, create resources, and develop skills.
</li>
<li>I also signed up for HackLab ($51.75 a month) as a way to connect with other geeks and have a place to work at when I'm downtown.
</li>
<li>I attended networking events ($170.45). AndroidTO was less useful than I expected because I hadn't actually been developing stuff then, although it was good sketchnoting practice. The Third Tuesdays Toronto events were definitely worth it for me. Rotman events were okay.
</li>
<li>I met four people for lunches/dinners and had lots of tea with others, talking about mentoring or business opportunities.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delegation</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I greatly increased my delegation budget compared to last year. I subcontracted $1,333.34 of my work. I delegated an additional $2,030.30.
</li>
<li>Hiring a virtual assistant to help with scheduling really helped me get past the hassles of booking people. Worth it.
</li>
<li>Hiring a transcriber for my podcasts and presentations worked out well, too.
</li>
<li>Hiring a local consultant to help me brainstorm was okay, but not amazing. It was a helpful nudge to work on my marketing, though.
</li>
<li>Hiring another on-shore consultant to give me feedback on my website and e-books was also okay but not amazing. It was great for pushing me to add more hand-drawn elements to my website, though.
</li>
<li>Hiring a developer to work on Rails prototypes gave me a leg up on dealing with various APIs, although I ended up not pursuing the projects.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I made $90 in e-book sales in FY 2013, which absolutely delights me. It's a tiny fraction of what I make in consulting or even sketchnoting or speaking, but it's a start. I've been moving towards a Pay What You Want model so that everyone can get access to the resources and people can show their appreciation by funding future experiments. My experiment-related savings take care of my living expenses, so everything goes to Making Stuff. I want to focus on making more things.

For this coming year, I'm planning to focus on consulting until it winds down. I'm also going to ramp up creating content: blog posts, drawings, articles, e-books, courses, and more. I often get requests to sketchnote events or other people's content, and I'd like to refer those to other people instead of handling them myself. That way, I can help other people grow, and I can make myself learn more about creating my own content.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ideally, by September 2014, I'll have:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a separate topic-focused weekly blog with evergreen posts and useful, well-formatted, illustrated articles
</li>
<li>several e-resources for that blog
</li>
<li>a mailing list that I've learned how to use
</li>
<li>and possibly a course that includes tips, worksheets, checklists, animations, and video
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I may also want to keep a "Wanted" board on my site so that I can funnel other requests to it. That way, instead of simply telling people no, I can help them a little further along the way and help other people grow their businesses too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here's my plan for getting there:</b>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Brainstorm headlines and article ideas to help me choose which topics I want to start a weekly topic-focused blog around.
</li>
<li>Get feedback on which topics people would like to read about first. Start collecting e-mail addresses for launch.
</li>
<li>"Bank" 4-8 good articles (write two months ahead). Invite early readers.
</li>
<li>Publicize it a bit more widely once I've gotten into the rhythm of publishing on the blog and I know that the rate is sustainable.
</li>
<li>Plan an outline for a brief e-book and gear my articles towards that.
</li>
<li>Reach out and find guest posting opportunities once the blog is more established.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To make the blog different and useful, I plan to illustrate the ideas with one-page cheat sheets / references. This will also make a handy collection.
</p>

<p>
<b>With that in mind, what are some ways I can reinvest some of my profits in order to make things better, and which ways make more sense than others?</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Buy premium plugins, scripts, or themes</b> to make navigating the blog or content easier.
</li>
<li><b>Buy books, read them, and give them away</b>. That way, I'm not limited to the library's selection. The library has lots of books and it could take forever for me to get through the backlog, but learning from and sharing tips from newly-published books may create more value for readers. Plus, if I set aside a budget for shipping (which is expensive in Canada!), I can give lightly-read copies away. I've had publishers send me copies of books to review, so maybe I can ramp that up also.
</li>
<li><b>Buy domain names</b> and learn how to set up landing pages.
</li>
<li><b>Work with copywriters and editors</b> and get better at writing.
</li>
<li><b>Sign up for a good mailing list service</b>, possibly with an autoresponder or digital delivery mechanism
</li>
<li><b>Get an assistant to help me with e-mail.</b>
</li>
<li><b>Buy SEO tools or work with a reputable company.</b> Sometimes little tweaks make things more findable or discoverable.
</li>
<li><b>Find a system administrator</b> who can help me review my config and who can answer questions from time to time
</li>
<li><b>Learn how to work with article writers</b> or pay for excellent guest posts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Worst-case scenario: They write the first draft, and I end up rewriting it extensively because I have a better idea of what I don't want.
</li>
<li>Best-case scenario: I give them a topic to write about, they come up with insights or research I might not have come across myself, and then I can personalize it with more stories or experiences.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Invest in better web planning and design</b>, maybe for the topic-focused blog
</li>
<li><b>Experiment with richer media</b>: animations, podcasts, video. Buy tools. Possibly delegate editing.
</li>
<li><b>Hire someone to format e-resources.</b> They can help develop the template and lay things out nicely.
</li>
<li><b>Go through a course</b> like the ones offered at Platform University, CopyBlogger, or ProBlogger. Apply the lessons and write about my experiences. Draw notes.
</li>
<li><b>Hire a coach</b> to help me learn more about planning posts, creating resources or courses, building a community, and so on.
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
I've been holding back from experimenting with new businesses. I'm not sure how the next few months are going to be like, and I don't want to make commitments like sketchnote event bookings or additional freelance contracts. Besides, <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/12/year-drawing-own-content/">focusing on my own stuff</a> has been an interesting experiment so far, and I want to continue it.
</p>

<p>
Still, from time to time, I get the itch to build systems and processes for creating value for other people. For example, when I talk to people who are struggling to find jobs or having a hard time building freelance businesses, I want to support and encourage them by helping them see opportunities. Talking about stuff can feel a bit empty, but actually <i>doing</i> stuff&#x2013;and showing how to do it&#x2013;is more helpful, especially since I seem to be more comfortable with sales, marketing, and business experimentation than many people are.
</p>

<p>
So, depending on how these next few months turn out, what are the
kinds of businesses that I'd like to build?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>E-books and other resources</b>: I like the way free/pay-what-you-want
information makes it easy for people to learn without friction and
still be able to show their appreciation through payment,
conversation, links, or other good things. I also like the scale of
it: I can spend some time working on a resource, and then people can
come across it when they need it. No schedule commitments, either.
</li>
<li><b>Software, maybe?</b>: Someday. The upsides of working on stuff that
other people use: feature suggestions, warm-and-fuzzies. The
downside: dealing with bugs. I think the first step would be to
build tools for myself.
</li>
<li><b>Visual book reviews?</b>: People seem to like these, and I enjoy
reading.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let me take a step back here and break that out into the specific
characteristics I like. If I identify those characteristics, I might
be able to recognize or imagine other businesses along those lines.
What attracts me?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Scale:</b> Build once, help many. I don't mind lower sales at the
beginning if I'm working on the kinds of things that people will
find useful over a long period of time.
</li>
<li><b>Accumulation:</b> I like collecting building
blocks in terms of content and skills because I can combine those in
interesting ways.
</li>
<li><b>Generosity:</b> I like free/pay-what-you-want because it allows me to
reach the most people and feel great about the relationships.
</li>
<li><b>Flexibility:</b> I like minimizing schedule or topic commitments
because that reduces stress and lets me adapt to what's going on.
Self-directed work fits me well.
</li>
<li><b>Distinction:</b> I like doing things that involve uncommon
perspectives or combinations of skills. I feel like I can bring more
to the table.
</li>
<li><b>Value:</b> I like things that help people learn more, understand
things better, save time or money, share what they know, or be more
excited about life.
</li>
<li><b>Other things I care about:</b> I care about making good ideas more
accessible, which is why I like transcripts, sketchnotes, writing,
and websites. I also care about helping good people do well, which
is why I help friends with their businesses.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Writing fits these characteristics pretty well. If I can help friends
through process coaching and things like that, I can learn more about
things that other people might find useful too. It's entirely possible
to build good stuff around just this <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/11/coming-up-with-a-three-word-life-philosophy/">learn-share-scale</a> cycle. Anything
else (spin-off businesses? software? services) would be a bonus.
</p>

<p>
I have a little more uncertainty to deal with. I can see the timeline
for it, so I'm okay with giving myself permission to take it easy for
the next couple of months. After that, I'll probably have a clearer
idea of what the rest of this experiment with semi-retirement (and
other follow-up experiments! =) ) could be like.
</p>

<p>
What would more focused writing or content creation look like? I might:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pick a subject people are curious about and write a series of blog posts that I can turn into e-books
</li>
<li>Revisit that <a href="http://sach.ac/outline">outline of things to write about</a> and flesh it in
</li>
<li>Organize blog posts and other content into downloadable resources
</li>
<li>Create courses so that people can go through things at a recommended pace and with multimedia content
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ooh, more animations
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think that would be an interesting life. =)
</p>

<p>
I still want to do something to help all these awesome people I come
across who are having a hard time finding jobs or building businesses
for themselves, though. It's odd hearing about their struggles while
at the same time watching the stock market keep going up - businesses
seem to be doing okay, but it's not trickling down? Maybe I'll spend
more time listening to people and asking what could help. Maybe I can
spend some time connecting with business owners and seeing if I can
understand their needs, too. Knowledge, ideas, and encouragement are
easy, but there are probably even better ways to help. Hmm&#x2026; That
gives me a focus for networking at events. Looking forward to helping!

How to say no to opportunities
</p>

<p>
(Needs more work)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When I started this 5-year experiment, I didn't know if I could
stick with it. My track record for sticking with interests is not
that good. I'm delighted to report that (semi-)retirement gets
easier and easier. I am learning to say no.
</li>
<li>By coincidence, two of my mentors (who had moved on to separate
companies after IBM) got in touch with me recently to find out if I
was interested in some upcoming job opportunities. Good stuff.
Right up my alley. Wonderful people.
</li>
<li>I said no. Actually, I said something along the lines of: Thank you
for reaching out! That sounds fantastic. However, I am semi-retired
and completely* unhireable for at least the next few years, so I'll
just have to wish you good luck on your search. I'm sure you'll find
someone awesome out there.
</li>
<li>(Of course, if a significant financial need comes up, I have no qualms about
suspending this experiment and returning to the wonderful world
of work. I enjoyed working with excellent teams. I'd love to do
it again.
</li>
<li>Learning how to say no is incredibly amazing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It helps to remember that there are other awesome people out there
who can make things happen.
</li>
<li>Sure, they might not bring my particular configuration of skills,
but they'll bring other useful combinations.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't even have a tiny internal voice of dissent
<ul class="org-ul">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-420">
<p>
I'm fascinated by books about applying advice to your life. "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/stunt-memoirs">Stunt
memoir</a>" seems to be the phrase for it. Part self-help book and part
memoir, these are usually broken up into one chapter per principle,
applying research or time-tested ideas to everyday life. Book titles
are often long multi-parters where the second part refers to the
adventure or lists an incongruous combination of techniques. The
authors illustrate principles with struggles, successes, and
epiphanies, and then eventually make their peace with the advice.
Oddly enough, chapters tend to fit rather neatly into the usual
three-act story structure - the storyteller's craft at work.
</p>

<p>
A year seems to be a common size for these experiments, often divided
into one principle per month: long enough to test ideas and write a
decent-sized book for print. I think that one principle a month looks
manageable for readers, too: not so short that you won't see changes,
and not so long that you'd get bored or discouraged.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=u_obbSgefBAC&dq=isbn:1416599061&source=gbs_navlinks_s">The Guinea Pig Diaries: My Life as an Experiment</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=H0S3V_XNKw4C&dq=the+happiness+project&source=gbs_navlinks_s">The Happiness Project: Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle and Generally Have More Fun</a>

</li>
</ul>

<p>
I imagine that writing such a book is good for self-improvement even
if no one else ever buys or reads it, so any sales are a bonus. I
wonder what the process of writing that kind of a book is like: how to
organize notes into a narrative, how to push yourself beyond what's
easy.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of experiments I could run along those lines:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Self-tracking</b>: focusing on quantifying different
things per month, bringing in research as well. Time, finance,
productivity, mood, habits, fitness, food, learning, thinking,
relationships, others
</li>
<li><b>Practical philosophy:</b> paying close attention to ancient wisdom and
applying that to daily life
</li>
<li><b>Behavioural economics and psychology in daily life:</b> rationality, decision-making, etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Still, I want to be careful about the kinds of things that have rubbed
me and other people the wrong way A month is not that long, and
sometimes these books feel a little&#x2026; shallow? Like someone's going
through the Cliff Notes for a deep idea, trying out a few things, and
then calling it a day. As if someone's just going through a checklist,
crossing off different techniques. There's also that consciousness of
privilege, and the self-absorption of memoirs. That said, I write
about my reflections a lot on this blog, so&#x2026; maybe? I tend to think
of it more as "Ack, there's so much I still have to figure out; if I
post my notes, maybe someone will take pity on me and share their
insights (or possibly recognize something that they might find useful
in theirs)" rather than "Here, learn from my life."
</p>

<p>
So&#x2026; I don't know. On one hand, I like the "I'm figuring this out
too" approach compared to the didactic awesomer-than-thou feel of many
self-help books. On the other hand, I'm not keen on the "My life is
incomplete and unhappy; I must search outside for ways to make it
better."
</p>

<p>
What's at the core of the things I like about these kinds of books?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Translates research or principles into everyday actions:</b> There's a
lot of good stuff buried in scientific language, abstract concepts,
or even self-help books. Sometimes it's hard to imagine applying
those ideas to real life, and seeing someone go through the process
(recovering from mistakes and all!) can help.
</li>
<li><b>Pays attention to things we often take for granted:</b> We do many
things repeatedly and with little attention. If we look closely at
them, we can get better. For example, if we think about a principle
and relate it to how we want to communicate, make decisions, or use
our time, we'll often find things that we can tweak and turn into
new habits.
</li>
<li><b>Shares the struggles and the little celebrations:</b> Self-help books
can feel a little too pat with all their success stories. I relate a
little better to stories along the lines of "Yeah, this was hard to
learn, but here's how I picked myself up and tried again. Here are
some things that made it a little easier for me until I got the hang
of it. This is what encouraged me to keep going, and now here I am.
Maybe this can help you too."
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Maybe less stunt-ish, then? I'm not thinking of these as radical
changes to my life ("Oh, I only have to do this a month at a time, for
a year"), but more like gradual improvement. I can always try things
informally, and then stitch the essays together into a book. It might
not be as impressive as spending one contiguous year focused on
something, packaging this up for other people's entertainment and
perhaps inspiration, but we'll see where it goes. =)

I set aside Tuesdays and Thursdays for consulting. Fridays are for
meetings and getting together with people. Saturdays are for spending
time with my husband or having the rare party, and Sundays are for
cooking and chores.
</p>

<p>
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are discretionary time. I could spend
those days working. My consulting clients would love to have more
time, and there are all sorts of other things I could work on as well.
</p>

<p>
I've been making myself find good uses of that time on my own, though.
Depending on the projects I'm focusing on, I might spend those days
coding, drawing, reading, or writing. Lately, I've been working my way
through a stack of philosophy books from the library. Histories give
me overviews and show me the relationships between thinkers, while
treatises give me the context for all these quotes that have been
floating around.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. Maybe that's what fascinates me about philosophy at the
moment. I've picked up bits and pieces of wisdom through quotes and
summaries. Now I want to learn more about the context of those sound
bites and the thought processes behind them. I want to reflect on the
maxims, choose the ones I want to apply to life, and learn how to
observe and improve. At some point, I'll probably feel that I can
learn more from experience than from books, and then I'll jump back
into the fray. In the meantime, it's amazing to be able to condense
centuries of thought into afternoons of reading. Not that I fully
understand everything, but there's enough to spark awareness and
recognition.
</p>

<p>
I'm not particularly interested in the big questions of metaphysics,
epistemology, or logic. Ethics, maybe&#x2013;small "e" ethics, not as much
the Ethics of What Everyone Ought To Do. I want to get better at
choosing what's good for me and doing it. The ancient Greeks have a
lot to say about that, and some of the later philosophers also do.
</p>

<p>
I'm not an entrepreneur, or at least not yet. I'm using this space and
capital to improve myself (or at least theoretically improve myself)
instead of building a business. I'm not even focused on learning a
marketable skill that I can list on my résumé, although I'm sure my
interests will turn towards that at some point. In the meantime, it
feels good to lay the groundwork for more clarity and better
decisions.
</p>

<p>
What's the next step? Well, since I'm interested in applied
philosophy, that probably means testing these ideas out in everyday
life. On the personal side, there's living simply and thoughtfully. On
the social side, maybe practising more loving-kindness. I don't think
I'm cut out to be a pure philosopher, so I'll likely use my time to
learn, code, write, and draw. I wonder what I'll be curious about
after I build a good foundation in this area. Useful skills, perhaps?
Design and aesthetics? Business? We'll see.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I'll give my mind enough space to unfold questions
and learn from the notes that people have left for us.

<p>
One of the ideas I'm mulling over from this study of ancient Greek
philosophy is this: Instead of using willpower to get through things
you don't like, you can learn to appreciate the things that are good
for you or gradually move up through activities that you enjoy and
that are a little better for you than what you were doing before.
</p>

<p>
I've been trying this idea in terms of exercise. Having decided that I
would be <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/06/this-is-the-year-im-going-to-build-an-exercise-habit/">the type of person who exercises</a>, I've been keeping up this
habit for a little over a month. I usually run with W-. He treats
those sessions as recovery runs (he's much fitter than I am and can
run circles around me), and I treat them as "extra time with W- <i>and</i>
an occasion for <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/01/the-smugometer/">smugness</a>." I'm not yet at the point of experiencing
the runner's high, but I do feel somewhat pleased by this ability to
keep up with the heart rate thresholds that should help me build up
endurance. I've even gone for runs on my own, propelled by growing
custom and the knowledge that I'm going to be able to celebrate
whatever progress I'm making. Gradual progress through <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/chapter1_2_5.html">the Hacker's
Diet exercise ladder</a> is fun, too.
</p>

<p>
In terms of food, I'm finally beginning to appreciate the sourness of
yogurt, the peppery taste of radishes, and other things I'm still not
particularly fond of but can deal with.
</p>

<p>
As for substitution, keeping a range of nonfiction books in the house
means I'm less inclined to spend time playing video games. Latin and
Japanese flashcards on my phone mean less time reading fiction. A file
full of writing ideas means less time spent browsing the Web.
</p>

<p>
We change a little at a time. It's good to pay attention to your
changing tastes, and to influence them towards what's good for you.
Sometimes you can kick it off with a little bribery or willpower, if
you use that temporary space to look for more things to appreciate.
Sometimes you can encourage yourself by making better activities more
convenient. Good to keep growing!

As an experiment (and because the timing works), I have a three-month
break coming up. It'll be quite a different experience from the
1-month breaks I've been taking so far, probably as different as the
way that having an entire weekday to yourself is different from
squeezing your activities into an evening. So I have a few questions to think about:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How can I make the most of that time?
</li>
<li>With the answers to that question in mind, how can I make the most
of the weekdays I have until then? How do those activities compare
with working a little more from August to September?
</li>
<li>Considering the most likely situations, how would I like to adjust
my work/discretionary-time balance?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It got me thinking about what I actually <i>do</i> during my leisure time,
and why. Oddly enough, despite the ability to spend lots of time
reading and writing, I still end up writing at roughly the same rate I
did back when I was working full-time. Some days the words flow freely
and I queue up a few posts, other days I'm casting about for ideas. My
reading has shifted a little, and for the better (I think). I doubt
I'd have had the patience to read philosophy and reflect on it slowly
back when I read in the evenings and the occasional weekend.
</p>

<p>
Aristotle writes in the <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i> on the topic of why we choose what we choose:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But that [virtue and vice] are concerned with the same things might become manifest to us also from these considerations: there being three objects of choice and three of avoidance&#x2013;the noble, the advantageous, and the pleasant together with their three contraries, the shameful, the harmful, and the painful&#x2013;in all these the good person is apt to be correct, the bad person to err, but especially as regards pleasure. (1104b30)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It might be useful, then, to reflect on these leisure activities and
figure out how they stack up against Aristotle's objects, along with
some notes on how adding more time to these activities makes sense.
This will help me make a decision about the months leading up to
November, and for after the break (depending on how things turn out).

<p>
Hmm. Tabulating and sorting it like this is actually pretty useful. I
can see why work is so tempting for me, despite the opportunity to do
other things. It is an opportunity to work towards and practise
nobility/excellence through work; it is advantageous in terms of
resources and reputation, which contributes to safety; and it's
pleasant, especially when I get a chance to do some rapid-prototyping
magic or some custom analytics.
</p>

<p>
Writing and drawing are less clear and more self-directed. But they
are useful techniques for working towards nobility; they are
advantageous both in terms of the content and the skills I develop;
and both the process and the results of figuring things out are
pleasant. If I spend more time and attention on these things, I can
improve my ability to observe and articulate. It may take me years to
get the hang of these skills, but they are good to develop.
</p>

<p>
I can develop both writing and drawing in the afternoons and evenings,
but I do notice a difference in attention. I usually watch movies in
the evening as a way of spending time with W-. This is okay for slow
and light writing, but does not lend itself well to study, deep
reflection, or application. When I worked full-time, I generally wrote
in the evenings (sometimes before dinner, sometimes shortly after) or
on one of the weekend afternoons. I like writing on weekday
afternoons, now. I like the pace. Would I pick that over consulting?
Yes, actually, depending on what kinds of tasks I'd work on. I can put
off writing when there are important and time-sensitive tasks to be
done, but writing is also important to me long-term, and I'm willing
to take on a little risk in order to experiment with it.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. If I do two to three days of work a week&#x2013;maybe even four&#x2013;from
now to October, while leaving at least one full day for writing,
that's probably good. I can front-load the writing, since that's
important to me. If I feel it could use more time, I might adjust what
I work on. I'll spend the usual time cooking and taking care of
house-things, although I might spend a little more time during the
week to cook fresh dinners. I can use the three-month break to
experiment with more writing and drawing. In the meantime, I can avoid
getting used to the additional income by stashing it all in a safety
net, opportunity fund, or similar budget. If we keep our lifestyle the
same, it's easy to evaluate work for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
Are there some smaller-value activities that I should spend more time
on instead of reading, writing, and drawing? Spending time with people
is nice, but it can be a little iffy in terms of energy, so I might
take the occasional opportunity and use the rest of the time on other
things. I can review my notes instead of reading lots of new books,
and use those notes for material for blog posts and experiments. When
I find myself looking for non-writing activities, this table might be
handy to review.
</p>

<p>
Let's see how this works out.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-424">
<p>
I've been gradually scaling down my consulting. I started with a plan
for consulting 3-4 days a week. Then I shifted to 2-3 days. Now I'm
planning to target a regular schedule of one day per week, with extra
for when there are important projects. I've been helping other team
members pick up my skills, so I'm looking forward to seeing what they
do with that. I think consulting one day a week will be a good next
step in terms of giving me a deeper experience of self-directed time
while still building on excellent client relationships.
</p>

<p>
What would be different if I work one day a week? I think this might
be a new tipping point, since I'll have a larger block of focused
time - up to four days, compared to the bursts of single discretionary
days of a Tue/Thu schedule. I'll find out whether I can keep enough
context in my head to make the most of spread-apart days, and if the
mental leakage is worth it. Alternatively, I might experiment with
working two afternoons a week, which still breaks up the week but
allows for more responsiveness and momentum.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, I find it easier and more fun to work on specific
people's ideas and challenges rather than come up with my own
solutions for the gaps I see. That said, I'm starting to branch out
and make things that I think people will like, and these have turned
out to be surprisingly helpful. Still, I've got a fair bit more to
learn before I can be one of those idea-slinging entrepreneurs.
</p>

<p>
What do I gain from consulting?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The impetus to solve specific problems (learning a lot along the way)
</li>
<li>The fulfillment of working on larger achievements
</li>
<li>Taking advantage of other people's skills without having to do the coordination myself
</li>
<li>Feedback and ideas from other people
</li>
<li>Interaction with a good team
</li>
<li>A bigger safety net (financial and professional)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
What other experiment modes do I want to try?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Active leisure: learning, writing, drawing, cooking, exercising, etc.
</li>
<li>Product development: using writing, drawing, and coding to practise creating things outside the time=money equation
</li>
<li>Open source contribution/maintainership: learning boost from commitments?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I suppose I could toss myself in the deep end and try a 0% schedule
earlier rather than later. I'm planning to take a few months to look
into this add-on development thing, and that should give me some more
information on what I need to learn and whether I can get the hang of it. =)

<p>
Much to try&#x2026;

I'm in the garden almost every day. Almost 40 hours in total since
the beginning of April. It's my new favourite transition activity
before dinner. I plant, water, pick off bugs. I'm beginning to learn
what leaves feel like when they haven't gotten enough water and when
they have. The oregano, mint, cilantro, basil, and lettuce are growing
much better than they did in previous years. None of the snow peas
have made it indoors yet, since I've been eating them off the vine.
The tomatoes, zucchini, winter melons, and bitter melons haven't hit
their stride yet, but maybe during the hotter months.
</p>

<p>
I like filling the salad spinner with cut-and-come-again leaves. I
should let some of the plants go to seed so that I can collect them
for the next batch, but it's too tempting to snip off the flowers in
order to keep the current batch going. I planted a salad mix, so I
have no idea what some of these are. I know bok choy, spinach,
arugula. Peppery and red-veined? Probably beet greens. I'm relying on
frequency here. If there's a lot of a type of plant, it grows in a
somewhat regular formation, and I don't already conclusively know it's
a weed, it's probably okay to eat. So far, so good.
</p>

<p>
I have salad every other day or so. Today I had three small bowls of
salad all by myself (W- had the other bowl). I shook up a quick
Asian-style dressing in a small mason jar and sprinkled sesame seeds
on top. We don't normally buy those boxes of salad mix, since I feel
guilty about not finishing them before they have to go. If it's still
growing, I don't mind, although I try to harvest leaves before the
slugs and leaf-miners get to them.
</p>

<p>
The salad garden is doing so much better this year compared to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/10/gardening-review-2013/">last
year</a>. Frequent watering and frequent harvesting, that's probably the
ticket. I should make pesto this week. Maybe Wednesday. Basil likes
being harvested often, too. =) I've been picking flowers off every
day, but there are definitely enough leaves here to make a good-sized
batch of pesto.

We were planning to make roasted cauliflower for the <a href="http://hacklab.to/">Hacklab</a> open
house dinner, but the cauliflowers were CAD 4.50+ each. Instead, we
made vegan Japanese curry (<a href="http://veganmiam.com/recipes/curry-japones-de-verduras-vegano-vegan-japanese-curry">roux recipe</a>), which has become one of my
favourite recipes. It's a great way to cook carrots, potatoes, green
beans, daikon, bell peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, peas, and other
vegetables you might have.
</p>

<p>
At home, I made another huge pot of Japanese curry, but with chicken
instead of tofu, and with a non-vegan <a href="http://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to/how-to-make-curry-roux/">roux recipe</a>. We tried it with
udon instead of rice. Udon gives it a chewier texture and it works
well too. I also made quickly-pickled <a href="http://www.justonecookbook.com/recipes/namasu-daikon-and-carrot-salad/">cucumber-daikon-carrot</a> salad,
which balanced the taste nicely. Not counting the rice, I think the
cost per portion worked out to be around $1.

<p>
J- loves Japanese food, so it's great to be able to make things at
home. Next time, I think I'll try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_lbq7GnG2A">making udon from flour, water, and
salt</a>. It doesn't require a pasta roller, just patience. On the other
hand, frozen udon is around CAD 4 for a pack of five and it takes one
minute to cook, so there's something to be said for that.

While I occasionally play with the idea of going on a cooking vacation
so that I can try local markets and learn from cooking classes,
there's so much that I haven't yet explored here. There are all these ingredients I haven't yet looked up and tried. (Thank goodness for such a diverse city!) Maybe someday I might even try out cooking lessons or private instruction.
</p>

<p>
For now, I'm focusing on cooking with more vegetables. I liked the
balance of meat to vegetables in that curry we made - about three
chicken thighs of meat in one of our biggest pots. It would be great to increase vegetable volume and variety. Looking forward to exploring the rest of the produce section!

It took me an hour to get from downtown to Hacklab on a stop-and-go Queen streetcar. Next time, I should probably take the King streetcar instead, or even go all the way north to Bloor and then south on the Dufferin bus. Anyway, I'd given myself enough of a buffer to not feel horribly guilty about being late meeting people who were expecting me there around 6-ish anyway, and that was when I made it. Max was already there when I arrived, and Gabriel joined us when we were at the supermarket picking up groceries.
</p>

<p>
Chris and Alaina were busy making two courses (korma and hot-and-sour soup), so I figured we'd go with an Indian vegan dessert to accompany the korma. Some rapid Googling turned up this Coconut Barfi recipe from Diwali Sweets (by way of <a href="http://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/coconut-barfi-recipe-vegan-diwali-sweets/">Veg Recipes of India's review</a>). We tripled the following recipe:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1/2 cup semolina flour (we used medium, but this might be better with fine)
</li>
<li>1/2 cup dry coconut flakes (we used shredded)
</li>
<li>1 tablespoon coconut oil
</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped cashew pieces (got roasted cashews from the bulk bin so that we could snack on them while cooking)
</li>
<li>pinch of salt
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the sugar syrup:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1/2 cup ground raw sugar (we used turbinado sugar, couldn't find anything raw)
</li>
<li>3 tablespoons water
</li>
<li>1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder (we ended up grinding our own, since the nearby supermarket doesn't stock powdered cardamom)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It took longer to make the sugar syrup than expected, but then again, I'm pretty new to syrup making, so I wasn't quite sure what "one thread consistency" meant. Anyway, it still turned out as nicely cardamom-scented nibble, crunchy without being jaw-breaking.
</p>

<p>
Gabriel generously remarked that the amount of salt I added made it remind him of salted caramels. I think perhaps a smaller pinch would do next time.

It was lots of fun cooking with both old friends and new acquaintances, and the kitchen at Hacklab supports having multiple people quite nicely (aside from a bit of stove coordination when we had three things on the go). Yay cooking!

For the Hacklab grand re-opening party, I made 58 vegan chocolate cupcakes using about four batches of this <a href="http://www.chow.com/recipes/10794-basic-vegan-chocolate-cupcake">Basic Vegan Chocolate Cupcake</a>. Each batch called for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1 cup soy milk
</li>
<li>1 tsp apple cider vinegar
</li>
<li>3/4 cup sugar
</li>
<li>1/3 cup canola oil
</li>
<li>1.5 tsp vanilla extract
</li>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour
</li>
<li>1/3 cup cocoa powder
</li>
<li>3/4 tsp baking soda
</li>
<li>1/2 tsp baking powder
</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt
</li>
</ul>

<p>
mixed and baked in a 400F oven for 18-20 minutes (20 minutes at Hacklab). Once cooled, we decorated them with this <a href="http://www.chow.com/recipes/10856-vegan-fluffy-buttercream-frosting">Vegan Fluffy Buttercream Frosting</a>, which called for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1/2 cup vegetable shortening
</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegan margarine
</li>
<li>3.5 cups icing sugar
</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract
</li>
<li>1/4 cup soy milk
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fortunately, Eric had donated an electric mixer (hand), so whipping up
the frosting was easy. The cupcakes were not too sweet, so the
frosting was a nice balance.
</p>

<p>
I also made 12 non-chocolate, non-vegan, gluten-free cupcakes from a
boxed mix, since some Hacklab members have those dietary restrictions.
Eric iced those with a different recipe.
</p>

<p>
It was actually pretty fun making dozens of cupcakes. Because they're in liners, it's easy to make large batches of them and set them cooling on whatever surfaces are handy. I started at 4ish and spent the whole afternoon cooking. I also had fun using the simple cake decoration kit to pipe letters and icing on it, although my hands were a smidge shaky. I actually forgot to add the soy milk and extract the first time around, but I caught it after icing the first ten cupcakes with something that was mostly sugar. After I beat in the soy milk, icing was a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
We don't really make a lot of desserts at home because we'd like to eat more healthily, but since J-'s friends are often over, maybe I should look into making more snacks to keep around the house. Probably not chocolate cupcakes - maybe something healthier? - but it's definitely baking season, so some kind of baked good. Then again, W- reminds me that a box of cookies on sale is pretty cheap, so we might as well use the time for other things.
</p>

<p>
I don't quite remember making cupcakes before the party. Maybe I've made cupcakes before, but just forgot about it? Anyway, they're not intimidating after all. =) And with vegan recipes, I can taste the batter a little to see if I'm on the right track!

I made sweet potato and miso soup yesterday, with popped wild rice and
Caesar salad on the side. W- made garlic bread with the baguette I
bought. It was yummy. The other day, I helped make butternut squash
and sweet potato soup at Hacklab, and that was well-received as well.
Yay!
</p>

<p>
Five years ago, before we discovered bulk cooking and bought a chest
freezer, W- used to cook every 1-2 days. I didn't know a lot of dishes
that I could confidently cook and he was so much better at cooking
than I was, so I was the sous chef. I helped prepare ingredients, make
rice, and cook simple recipes. He'd come home early to make dinner,
and we packed leftovers for lunch the next day.
</p>

<p>
Now I cook most of our experimental meals, trying new recipes in the
search for future favourites. I also enjoy refilling the chest freezer
with time-tested meals like chicken curry and shake-and-bake chicken.
Our next goal is to work out a good rotation of known favourites,
sprinkling in new recipes here and there.
</p>

<p>
It feels great to be able to cook&#x2013;and to take charge of the kitchen,
which is an interesting experience. I'm usually trying recipes for the
first time, or experimenting with a new variant of a recipe that we've
had before. I'm never quite sure how it will work out, but since we
have backups (hooray for leftovers and low expectations!), it's okay
to stretch and learn. Besides, with all these years ahead of me
(probably), the more exploration I do now, the more it will pay off in
terms of skills and knowledge.
</p>

<p>
So probably every Tuesday or so, I'll be learning a new recipe
(helping out at Hacklab). Two or three times a week, I'll also try a
new recipe at home - maybe Wednesday and Sunday, or something like
that. I'm also working on rediscovering old favourites and writing
them down in the shared Evernote notebook I've set up with W-, and
maybe transitioning to a grocery/recipe system I'm building for the
two of us.
</p>

<p>
Nice to have a kitchen and the time to cook! =)

The <code>:var data=abbrev</code> argument to the Emacs Lisp source block is
where all the magic happens. Here, it takes the data from the table
named "abbrev" (which I set using <code>#+NAME:</code> before the table) and
makes it available to the code. Emacs evaluates that data when the
code is tangled (or exported) to my configuration. The code that's
in my <code>Sacha.el</code> looks like this:

You can do more complex things with Org tables, too. Inspired by Eric Boyd's talk on his <a href="http://quest.digitalcrusader.ca/">Epic Quest of Awesome</a> (which he based on <a href="http://nerdfitness.com/blog/epic-quest/">Steve Kamb</a>'s), I started putting together <i>my own</i>. I made a list of little achievements, guessed at the years, and assigned arbitrary experience points.
</p>

<p>
The <b>achievements</b> table had rows like this:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

I wanted to summarize the points by year: points gained, total points, level (according to a lookup table based on D&amp;D experience points), and description. The lookup table was structured like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-meta-line">#+TBLNAME: levels</span>
<span class="org-org-table">| Total XP | Level | Adjective             |</span>

<span class="org-org-table">|        0 |     1 | trained-initiate      |</span>

Now for the summary table. I created rows for different years, and then I used Org Mode to fill in the rest. (Org Mode! Wow.)

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>TBLFM</code> (table formula) line is very long, so let me break it down.
</p>

<p>
<b>Points gained:</b>
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(calc-eval
 (format <span class="org-string">"vsum(%s)"</span>
         (vconcat
          (org-lookup-all
           $1
           '(remote(accomplishments,@2$1..@&gt;$1))
           '(remote(accomplishments,@2$3..@&gt;$3))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This uses <code>org-lookup-all</code> to look up the value of the first column
(<code>$1</code>) in the <code>accomplishments</code> table, from the second row to the last
row <code>@2..@&gt;</code>, looking in the first column (<code>$1</code>). It returns the
values from the third column of the matching rows (<code>$3</code>). This is then
passed through calc's <code>vsum</code> function to calculate the sum.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cumulative points:</b> <code>vsum(@2$2..@+0$2)</code> is the sum of the second column <code>$2</code> from the second row <code>@2</code> to the current row <code>@+0</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Level:</b> This uses <code>org-lookup-last</code> to find the last value where the
operator function returns true. In this case, testing the level from
column <code>$3</code> against each of the values in the <code>levels</code> table's column
<code>$1</code> while the given level is greater than or equal to the value from
<code>levels</code>. When it finds the last matching row, it returns the <code>$2</code>
second column from it. <code>;N</code> means treat everything as a number.
</p>

<p>
<code>org-lookup-first</code> is like <code>org-lookup-last</code>, but it returns the first
matching row.
</p>

<p>
<b>Adjective:</b> This one works like <b>Level</b> does, but it returns the
value from column <code>$3</code> instead. I found that it converted the return
values to <code>0</code> if I used <code>;N</code>, so I used <code>;L</code> instead.

I like including source code in published pages for fellow geeks, but having the results come first gives people more context for the source block. So I named the source block using the <code>#+name:</code> directive and defined a <code>#+RESULTS:</code> directive before it. The source block used the <code>:var</code> argument to bring the data in from the <code>accomplishments</code> table. With R blocks, the data becomes available as a data frame that you can then do interesting things with. I used the <code>:file</code> argument to save the output to <code>quest_category.png</code>.
</p>

<p>
Those are a few ways that you can get data out of Org Mode tables and
into Emacs Lisp, other Org Mode tables, or external programs. As I
learn more about Org Mode, I find myself using it for more of the
things that I used to use Microsoft Excel for - tracking, analyzing,
and even graphing. I found it a little difficult to piece together
what I needed to do from the manuals and examples on the Web, so I
hope this explanation will help you (and that it'll help me when I
forget the syntax, as I'm sure I will). If you come up with something
really neat that uses Org Mode tables, tell me what you've figured
out!

I'd been thinking about my blog post on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27826&shareadraft=baba27826_54b6a58e2a4d7">"Getting started with Emacs?

<p>
Since I'm also getting used to asking for help, <a href="https://twitter.com/sachac/status/555122049681604608">I asked folks on
Twitter</a> to help me figure this out. @wobher suggested splitting it up
into <a href="https://twitter.com/wobher/status/556872362298048513">two approaches</a>: diving in at the deep end, and wading in
gradually. In an e-mail, <a href="http://mph.puddingbowl.org/">Mike Hall</a> suggested simplifying the post,
sketching out what the post was trying to do and how that might be
spread over several chunks.
</p>

<p>
Reflecting on the post some more, I realized that not only was Mike
right that the post trying to do too much, but I also felt weird about
the tone of the post. It didn't feel&#x2026; sympathetic enough. I'd
written it in response to someone's frustrated e-mail. But if I
imagined myself in the same situation &#x2013; annoyed with Emacs, tempted
to switch back to a tool that I was more used to &#x2013; I didn't feel like
that post would help me either learn Emacs or feel better. In fact, it
would probably feel worse. "You need to empty your cup" almost feels
like "You're learning this the wrong way," and attacks put people on
the defensive.
</p>

<p>
Part of this challenge, I think, is that I'm more used to encouraging
people who respond like I do. When I'm faced with something I have a
hard time figuring out, I tend to blame myself, and so I look for ways
to get better. When I meet people who struggle with learning Emacs and
who might be tempted to translate that into an "I'm just not good
enough to learn this," I share what works for me: breaking it down
into small chunks and learning those, building both skill and
confidence at the same time. My cup is not full at the beginning, but
I sometimes worry about it being too small.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I haven't quite figured out how to deal with people's frustration. I
think there are times when Emacs is just not a good fit for someone,
and that if they understand that, they might still be open to
revisiting Emacs instead of writing it off entirely.
</p>

</p>

<p>
But I know a little bit of that frustration with one's slowness, so
maybe that's how I can connect. After all, I have the same flaws.
</p>

<p>
So I revised the post, cutting out the distracting parts and adding a
little identification. The <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27826&shareadraft=baba27826_54b6a58e2a4d7">current draft</a> feels a little better now:
less like a distracted hamster trying to cram ideas into its pouches,
less like a white-bearded sensei handing down wisdom from a remote
mountain. I have a slightly better grasp on the weird feeling when a
post is trying to do too much, and that other weird feeling when a
post creates too much distance.
</p>

<p>
If you have more suggestions for improving that post (or any of these
other posts), please share them. Your perspective can point out
something in my blind spot or help me clarify what I really mean.
There's so much I have yet to learn about writing and sharing, and I
hope you'll help me with your feedback!
</p>

<p>
(By the way, can anyone recommend a service for sharing drafts and
revisions publicly so that people can see previous revisions and
word-level differences with arbitrary commits? Sometimes I use
Github's diff or <code>git diff --color-words</code>, but the matching isn't
always correct. I can't figure out how to get Draftin.com to do this
nicely. Maybe I'll just have to get used to writing one sentence per
line, like I've seen some Org Mode users do. Or maybe it's time to use
the one-Org-file-for-post pattern that other people do, so that's
easier to preview and diff&#x2026;)

Mwahahaha. My <a href="http://sachachua.com/evil-plans">evil plans</a> are yielding results, or at least that's the
impression I get because I'm learning so much from people who tell me

experiments bear fruit: punchagan checked out Memacs because of my

<p>
This makes me curious: <b>What am I doing right, and how can I do it even
better?</b>
</p>

<p>
Looking at my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs">Emacs posts</a>, it seems I mostly write about figuring
things out (and occasionally about cool things I've come across).
People like the enthusiasm, and they sometimes pick up cool ideas too.
The Emacs Hangouts and Emacs Chats are my way of working around my
limitations; I don't particularly like travel and I'm not up to
organizing in-person meetups, but virtual meetups let me reach out to
more people (and we can record the conversations more easily, too).
</p>

<p>
What are my goals?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want to get better at using Emacs, because it's useful and it tickles my brain
</li>
<li>I want to help more people become intermediate and advanced users of
Emacs, because then I get to learn from them (and also Emacs thrives
as a community). I can do this by:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Showing people the benefits and possibilities of customization
</li>
<li>Working out loud, showing my thought processes and the tools/libraries I use
</li>
<li>Helping people develop a good mindset and handy skills
</li>
<li>Sharing little tips and neat functions
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
How can I get even better at helping the Emacs community?

<p>
I really like the way <a href="http://oremacs.com/">(or emacs</a> has daily Emacs snippets and <a href="http://rubikitch.com/">Rubikitch</a>
describes Emacs packages in Japanese. I think I'll slowly ramp up from
once-a-weekish Emacs posts to maybe twice or three times a week. I
have more posts already scheduled, but I just spread them out so that
my non-geek readers don't get overwhelmed.

<p>
Because I'm interested in things that tend to be idiosyncratic
(workflows, customizations, etc.), I have a hard time making clear
recommendations or putting tips into logical order. That's probably
why I do a lot more "thinking out loud"-type posts instead. I can
experiment with identifying who might find a tip useful, extract the
tips from my thinking-out-loud explorations, and gradually build up
sets of related tips that way.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-440">
<p>
I've been going back to the basics, working on developing even better
Emacs microhabits. I've focused on two so far: abbreviating text and
switching windows.I think there's plenty of space to improve even in
terms of taking advantage of what's already out there (with minimal
configuration along the lines of setting variables and keyboard
shortcuts). And then there are even bigger opportunities to improve
through customization and Emacs Lisp.

I've mentioned <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/06/emacs-coaching/">coaching</a> a few times. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/emacs-coaching-unknowns-figuring-want-learn/">Bastien Guerry and a few other
folks</a> offer coaching as a service. Me, I'm not particularly familiar
with the kinds of issues people run into or are curious about (ex: Mac
OS X, programming mode setup). I'm mostly curious about workflow, and
I'm happy to talk to people about that. It could be a good
source of ideas for blog posts.

</p>

<p>
When I ran my Google Helpouts experiments, I turned many of those tips
into blog posts. I think that would be even more effective if people
wrote up those tips themselves (it'll reinforce their learning <i>and</i>
it will bring them into the community), so I've been playing with the
idea of strongly encouraging or even requiring write-ups.

</p>

<p>
Unrealistic, but one can dream. Or one can focus on helping people who
are already sharing their questions and ideas in blog posts or
discussion forums, so that's another approach. There's no shortage of
questions, that's for sure.

<p>
I like Emacs Hangouts more than one-on-one coaching. Hangouts are
public and recorded automatically, so people can learn from them even
if no one has posted notes. It's shaping up to be a wonderful
peer-coaching sort of thing, which is good because I don't have to be
so worried about not being able to help at all. I wonder what this
would be like with a bit of a mastermind group structure; maybe we
each pick a microhabit or idea to work on for the month (or for two
weeks), we help each other out, and then we report back at the next
one. That way, there's casual conversation and discovery, but there's
also purpose and motivation.

Evil-mode users are a growing part of the Emacs community. Maybe I

toolkit.

When I work with a large monitor, I often divide my Emacs frame (what
most people call a window) into two or more windows (divisions within
a frame). I like this more than dealing with multiple Emacs frames,
even if I could spread those frames across multiple monitors. I find
it easier to manage the windows using keyboard shortcuts than to
manage the tiling and display of frames.
</p>

<p>
One of the Emacs micro-habits I'm working on is getting better at
switching between windows. When there are only two windows, <code>C-x o</code>
(<code>other-window</code>) works just fine. However, when there are three or
more, it can take a few repetitions of <code>C-x o</code> to get to where I want.
I could get around that by binding <code>other-window</code> to <code>M-o</code> instead,
replacing the default keymap for that. Or I could try to get the hang
of other ways to move around.
</p>

<p>
Here's an 8-minute video showing <code>windmove</code>, <code>ace-window</code>, and <code>ace-jump</code>:

Here's the relevant code snippet for Windmove - I changed this to use <code>define-key</code> instead of <code>bind-key</code>.

</p>

<p>
Naturally, after recording the video, I thought of a better way to
manage my windows, taking advantage of the <code>def-repeat-command</code> that
abo-abo posted on <a href="http://oremacs.com/2015/01/14/repeatable-commands/">(or emacs</a>. I modified the function to accept <code>nil</code>
as the first value if you don't want the keymap to run a command by
default, and to use <code>kbd</code> for the keybinding definitions.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">  (<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">sacha/def-rep-command</span> (alist)

<span class="org-doc">It sets the transient map to all functions of ALIST,</span>
<span class="org-doc">allowing you to repeat those functions as needed."</span>
    (lexical-let ((keymap (make-sparse-keymap))
                  (func (cdar alist)))
      (mapc (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x)
              (<span class="org-keyword">when</span> x

            alist)

        (set-transient-map keymap t))))

</div>

<p>
Here's my new binding for <code>yy</code>. It lets me bounce on <code>y</code> to use
<code>other-window</code> as normal, use the arrow keys to move between windows
thanks to <code>windmove</code>, and use <code>ace-window</code> as well: <code>h</code> is the regular
ace-window, <code>s</code> swaps, and <code>d</code> deletes.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

I want to publish things in chunks that are bigger and more logical
than blog posts, so I've been experimenting with my ZIP/PDF/EPUB/MOBI
workflow.
</p>

<p>
Org Mode, Calibre, and Vagrant are terrific tools. Org Mode lets me
write easy-to-modify source that I can export to different formats,
like HTML and LaTeX (with the Beamer package), which lets me use
PdfLatex to convert to PDF. Calibre converts HTML to EPUB and MOBI.
Since tools can be difficult to set up on Windows, I use Vagrant to
set up a virtual machine running Linux and I share my working
directory with it.
</p>

<p>
<code>Multiple-cursors</code> was so useful when I was wrangling the directory
listing into the right format for Org. I'm glad I learned how to use
it!
</p>

<p>
Here's a Makefile I put together that simplifies the process for me:
</p>

<p>

<p>
And here's a very simple build.el:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">require</span> '<span class="org-constant">package</span>)
(package-initialize)

(setq org-export-with-section-numbers nil)
(setq backup-directory-alist '((<span class="org-string">"."</span> . nil)))
</pre>

<p>
This assumes I've already set up the environment by installing the latest Org from MELPA.
</p>

<p>
You can check out the <a href="https://github.com/sachac/sketched-books/blob/master/index.org">index.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sachac/sketched-books/blob/master/ebook.org">ebook.org</a> I use, too.
</p>

<p>
I'm not quite sure about the MOBI output yet. I have to test it on a
Kindle, or in the app on my tablet. Most of the things display fine on
my computer, though. Hooray!
</p>

<p>
Neat, huh? I want to get into the habit of making and also making it
easy for me to update these things. You can check out the results at
<a href="http://sketchedbooks.com/collection">http://sketchedbooks.com/collection</a> .
</p>

<p>
Someday I might even figure out how to use the Gumroad API to publish
updated resources automatically. Wouldn't that be neat? In the
meantime, I'll just have to replace them myself.
</p>

<p>
I like giving people the ability to choose which files to download. If
I get annoyed with replacing multiple files, though, I might change
this to one large ZIP that has the images, PDF, EPUB, and MOBI.

<p>
One of the awesome things that Karl Voit demonstrated in this <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/emacs-chat-karl-voit-2/">Emacs
Chat</a> was how he used <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Yasnippet">YASnippet</a> and Org Mode to quickly create
projects with several related tasks, such as when organizing a group
to attend an event. He selected the snippet and filled in different
fields like the artist name and the event date, and Emacs generated
all these sub-tasks and e-mail templates with the information
already filled in.
</p>

<p>
I've used YASnippet once or twice, but mostly I've been using
<code>org-capture</code> and <code>org-capture-templates</code> instead. YASnippet looks
like it might be more flexible because you can fill in fields in a
non-linear order and you can re-evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions as
you type.
</p>

<p>
Lots of people do cool things with YASnippet. For example, it's
popular for programming because it lets people quickly expand short
sequences into longer syntax. Check out this <a href="http://emacsrocks.com/e06.html">Emacs Rocks episode on
YASnippet</a> to get a sense of what it can do. (Note: YASnippet has
changed its naming convention slightly, so things like <code>yas/text</code>
have been replaced with <code>yas-text</code>.) People have used it for <a href="http://blog.binchen.org/posts/how-to-use-yasnippets-to-produce-email-templates-in-emacs.html">e-mail
templates</a> and to fill in <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=2211">metadata for blog posts</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to use YASnippet more. Where can I integrate it into my
workflow? Probably wherever checklists and templates make sense.
I've been thinking about <b>checklists and templates</b> as a way to
improve how I do things.
</p>

<p>
<b>Checklists</b> are good for making sure that you complete tasks more
consistently, not missing any important steps. You can work faster
when there's a guide, since you don't have to keep thinking of the
next step each time. The simple act of checking things off can
encourage you to put in more effort, since the list shows you your
progress. It also makes it easier to remember to follow up.
</p>

<p>
<b>Templates</b> help you improve the structure of your work. You can
make sure you cover all the important parts. If you use similar
structures for many things, then people get used to finding
information in the same logical places. This doesn't mean that
you're stuck with cookie-cutter formats. You can still adapt the
format to your needs.
</p>

<p>
I'm particularly interested in using checklists and templates to
improve in three areas:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Programming:</b> I'd like to write with less friction and use best practices like testing
</li>
<li><b>Helping the Emacs community:</b> Checklists can help me make sure I do all the steps to prepare for and make the most of Emacs Hangouts and Emacs Chats. They might also lower the intimidation factor so that I end up scheduling these more often.
</li>
<li><b>Writing:</b> I think checklists and templates will help me invest more time into developing thoughts, relationships, and structure.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-456" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="unnumbered-456">Programming</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-456">
<p>
As mentioned, YASnippet's popular for programming. You can take
advantage of existing collections of snippets for different
programming modes (ex: <a href="https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets/tree/master">AndreaCrotti's collection</a>), or you can define
your own.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to get better at developing single-page applications using
AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap / Zurb Foundation, and NodeJS.
YASnippet might let me quickly put together short applications and
test suites. If I get my workflow smooth enough, I might even be
able to do an app-a-week (or app-a-day) sprint for deliberate
practice. There are often lots of fiddly little syntax or keyword
things that I look up while writing code. While practising typing
those things in again and again will help me memorize them, there's
also some value in automating that part with snippets so that I can
focus on the core skills of designing and implementing small web
applications.
</p>

<p>
YASnippet might also be able to help me use Org Mode to keep track
of ideas for features or small web applications throughout the
implementation process. I wonder if I should implement this using
lots of subtasks or using TODO states with logs. TODO states might
be easier to filter or visualize with the <code>kanban</code> package for Org
Mode. Maybe I'll try both approaches. In any case, checklists will
help me remember to think about designs and tests before
implementing the code, and maybe I can keep track of deployment
notes, lessons learned, and follow-up tasks.

<p>
I find checklists to be really helpful when setting up live
videocasts. I'm usually too frazzled to think of all the steps I
need to do at the last minute. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/11/my-new-google-hangouts-on-air-workflow-plus-upcoming-nov-29-qa-on-learning/">Paper checklists</a> are good because I
can refer to them while keeping my screen ready to be recorded.
Still, an Org Mode-based checklist (possibly with dynamic date
fields and e-mail templates provided by YASnippet) might go a long
way towards standardizing the before- and after-event process, and
that might in turn reduce the friction enough for me to do more of
them. Both Emacs Chats and Emacs Hangouts seem to be popular, so it
would be good to get more of these on the go.
</p>

<p>
The process would be something like:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Reach out to the person who's going to be featured on the Emacs
Chat, or at least one other person who's willing to be there for
the Emacs Hangout (so that I don't end up talking to myself for
the first ten minutes, which is Awkward)
</li>
<li>Figure out what will be discussed (for Emacs Chats)
</li>
<li>Set up a time, considering timezones
</li>
<li>Set up the Google+ event page
</li>
<li>Update the Google Calendar
</li>
<li>Post a notice on Twitter and on my blog (I've been forgetting to do this step)
</li>
<li>On the day of the event
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Do the last-minute push (I've been forgetting to do this as well)
</li>
<li>Create the Google Hangout on Air
</li>
<li>Set it up for Q&amp;A
</li>
<li>Invite the other person in for Emacs Chats, or post the URL for Emacs Hangouts
</li>
<li>Host the video chat
</li>
<li>Remind people where the recording can be found
</li>
<li>Update the Google+ page with the link to the next thing
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Extract the MP3 from the video, change the properties, and upload it to archive.org
</li>
<li>Post a blog post with the embedded video, podcast audio, and quick notes
</li>
<li>Transcribe the video or pay for transcription
</li>
<li>Edit the transcript
</li>
<li>Update the post with the transcript
</li>
<li>Update the Google+ event page with the link to the transcript, post to social networks (I've been forgetting this)
</li>
<li>Update EmacsLife.com, too (yet another thing I've been forgetting)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I think it would be totally awesome to get to the point where I can
call an Emacs Lisp function that would Do The Right Thing at that
point, like posting to Twitter or using something like <code>org-trello</code>
to make a Trello card and assign it to the person who does my
transcriptions.

<div id="outline-container-unnumbered-458" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="unnumbered-458">Writing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-458">
<p>
I'm getting the hang of using outlines to write (and I should post a
video about this soon), but it might be even cooler if I can get the
hang of writing with more structure. For example, Michael Hyatt
posted this <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/how-to-use-evernote-as-a-blogger.html">blog post checklist</a> that he had been using with
Evernote. I like it because:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The template asks you to be explicit about the post's objective and subject.
</li>
<li>It encourages you to add more illustrations, links, and stories.
</li>
<li>It reminds you to take steps that you might otherwise skip, and you might spend several days revising the post.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I might not use it for every post, but it's good to flesh out some
ideas further, especially the ones where I think I'm onto something
particularly interesting.
</p>

<p>
It would be even cooler if I could take advantage of YASnippet's
dynamic Emacs Lisp evaluation to remind me of relevant links from my
blog post outline given the category. I remember playing around with
the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/remem">Remembrance Agent</a>, which monitored a few hundred words around your
cursor and brought up files that had similar words. Matching on
category isn't going to be anywhere as sophisticated, but it still
might be a good way to refresh my memory. Even if I had a quick Emacs
Lisp interactive function that read whatever category property I'd set
(chosen from the <code>org-refile</code>-able targets) and displayed the section
from <a href="http://pages.sachachua.com/sharing/blog.html">my blog post index</a> in another window, I think that would be a
pretty neat start.
</p>

<p>
I tend to draft posts within my sharing outline (which I sporadically
publish at <a href="http://pages.sachachua.com/sharing/">http://pages.sachachua.com/sharing/</a>). When I'm done, I
delete the subtree, sometimes replacing it with a link to the post to
help me follow up on it in the future. This means losing that
metadata, though. It might be interesting to keep the metadata so that
I can review the goals and backstory of a blog post.
</p>

<p>
YASnippet can also help me keep track of the TODOs related to a post
as well. For example, I might want to come up with sketches, tweet
links, or follow up on ideas. If I use a YASnippet to plan my blog
post in the first place, then I can create a TODO (possibly with a
link back to the blog post) that I could leave in place or refile to
the appropriate location in my regular Org Mode files.
</p>

<p>
I don't think YASnippet dynamic fields persist after the file is saved
and reloaded, though. How would that work if I need to change things?
Maybe I can use <code>multiple-cursors</code> to mark all the matching text in
the subtree, or do other clever things with it&#x2026;

Okay. It looks like setting up YASnippet for Emacs checklists would probably give me the quickest win. Programming is also pretty straightforward. Writing might be interesting too, if I can get the hang of working with that kind of structure. Let's see how that goes. Once I figure out what those snippets will be like, I'll post them on Github somewhere. =)

Frustrated with Emacs because you're just not as productive as you are with your old editor? Copying configuration snippets from the Web in order to force it to work like what you're used to, but running into problems with conflicting code or obscure error messages?
</p>

<p>
Here's something I've realized. To learn Emacs well, you need to empty your cup. This is the story as told on the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmptyYourCup">C2 wiki</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A master was trying to explain something to a student. Now this
student was not a brand new student, but a senior student who had
learned many things. He had knowledge and experience aplenty to draw
upon. But each time the master tried to explain something new to the
student, the student kept trying to hold it up against his own notions
of the way the world is and how it ought be, and he was unable to see
the lessons in what the master was trying to teach him.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the master poured a full serving of tea into his own cup, and
into the cup of the student. Then he told the student he wanted to
give to him some of the tea from his own cup. He began pouring tea
from his cup into the student's cup, but the student's cup was already
full, and all the tea from the master's cup spilled out over the cup
onto the surface below.
</p>

<p>
The student said, "Master, you can't pour anything into my cup until I
empty it to make room for what you are trying to give me.", and the
master replied "Yes I know." "And I can't give you any new thoughts or
ideas or perspectives on life's lessons until you clear out some
thoughts that are already teeming in your mind to make room for what I
have to teach you." Then the master paused for a brief moment, meeting
the student's eyes with his own knowing look and calmly but sternly
said: " If you truly seek understanding, then first, empty your cup!"
</p>

<p>
The student pondered for a moment with a look of absolute
bewilderment. Then a look of enlightenment came over him, followed by
a smile, and a look of receptiveness. The master started to explain
again, and this time the student saw what the master was trying to
say.
</p>
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>
Emacs beginners often grumble about the strange keyboard shortcuts and terminology. "Why can't I use Ctrl-X to cut? Why is it called 'killing text'? Why doesn't it work like <span class="underline">__</span>?"
</p>

<p>
Some of those differences seem easy to fix with code you can get on the Net. But if you do that &#x2013; if you give in to your initial discomfort &#x2013; you may find yourself fighting more and more of Emacs as you go along, without the skills to properly integrate your changes. Packages that significantly change the behaviour of Emacs to make it more similar to another editor can make it harder to get help from the main Emacs communities.
</p>

<p>
It's better, I think, to approach Emacs as a beginner. Pretend this is your first editor. Go through the tutorial. Start with the basics. Try doing things the Emacs way.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning, you might feel agonizingly slow. You may need to do this in your discretionary time instead of when everyone is counting on you to deliver a time-sensitive project. It's okay to open up Vim or your previous editor so that you can get something done, while you keep learning Emacs in the background.
</p>

<p>
As you become familiar with the system, you learn how to work within it. Slowly configure things. Get used to the changes before you introduce more. Eventually, you'll understand the configuration snippets that other people post. <a href="http://emacslife.com/how-to-read-emacs-lisp.html">Reading Emacs Lisp</a> is the first step to being able to <b>modify</b> Emacs Lisp, and from there you can learn how to <b>write</b> Emacs Lisp. But you don't have to start knowing that right away; many people use Emacs for years before moving to that point, and many people use it without customizing it.
</p>

<p>
But if you start learning Emacs by getting frustrated with it and trying to force it to be what you want, you might never get to the point where you can enjoy it and work with it. Be a beginner. Give yourself time and space to learn, even if you feel you're learning slowly. Then, as you improve your understanding and skills, you'll learn how to coax Emacs to fit you even better.

you get <code>ace-jump</code> type behaviour allowing you to quickly zap to any

that way.

<p>
Let me think about how I organize my
Org Mode files, and how I might improve that. =)
</p>

<p>
<b>Separate files</b>
</p>

<p>
You can put different things in different files, of course. I use a
few large Org files instead of lots of small ones because I prefer
searching within files rather than searching within directories.
Separate files make sense when I want to define
<code>org-custom-agenda-commands</code> that summarize a subset of my tasks. No
sense in going through all my files if I only want the cooking-related
ones.
</p>

<p>
What would help me make better use of lots of files? I can practise on
my book notes, which I've split up into one file per book. It's easy
enough to open files based on their titles (which I put in my
filenames). But I don't have that overall sense of it yet. Maybe
<code>#+INDEX:</code> entries, if I can get them to generate multiple hyperlinks
and I have a shortcut to quickly grep across multiple files (maybe
with a few lines of context)? Maybe a manual outline, an index like
the <a href="http://pages.sachachua.com/sharing/blog.html">one I've been building for my blog posts</a>? I can work with that as
a starter, I think.
</p>

<p>
Okay. So, coming at it from several directions here:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A manual map based on an outline with lots of links, with some links between topics as well - similar to my blog outline or to my <a href="http://pages.sachachua.com/evil-plans/">evil plans</a> document
</li>
<li>Quick way to grep? <code>helm-do-grep</code> works, but my long filenames are hard to read.
</li>
<li>Links between notes and to blog posts
</li>
<li>TODOs, agenda views
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Outlines</b>
</p>

<p>
Within each file, outlines work really well. You can create any number
of headings by using <code>*</code>, and you can use <code>TAB</code> to collapse or expand
headings. You can promote or demote subtrees, move them around, or
even sort them.
</p>

<p>
I generally have a few high-level headings, like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-level-1">* Projects</span>
<span class="org-org-level-2">** One heading per current project</span>
<span class="org-org-level-3">*** </span><span class="ATTRLIST">TODO</span><span class="org-org-level-3"> Project task</span>
<span class="org-org-level-1">* Reference</span>
Information I need to keep track of
<span class="org-org-level-1">* Other notes</span>
<span class="org-org-level-1">* Tasks</span>
<span class="org-org-level-2">** </span><span class="ATTRLIST">TODO</span><span class="org-org-level-2"> Lots of miscellaneous tasks go here</span>
<span class="org-org-level-2">** </span><span class="ATTRLIST">TODO</span><span class="org-org-level-2"> Lots of miscellaneous tasks go here</span>
<span class="org-org-level-2">** </span><span class="ATTRLIST">TODO</span><span class="org-org-level-2"> Lots of miscellaneous tasks go here</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Every so often, I do some clean-up on my Org files, refiling or
archiving headings as needed. This makes it easier to review my
current list of projects. I keep this list separate from the grab-bag
of miscellaneous tasks and notes that might not yet be related to
particular projects.
</p>

<p>
I use <code>org-refile</code> with the <code>C-u</code> argument (so, <code>C-u C-c C-w</code>) to
quickly jump to headings by typing in part of them. To make it easy to
jump to the main headings in any of my agenda files, I set my
<code>org-refile-targets</code> like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq org-refile-targets '((org-agenda-files . (<span class="org-builtin">:maxlevel</span> . 6))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
How can I get better at organizing things with outlines? My writing
workflow is a natural place to practise. I've accumulated lots of
small ideas in my writing file, so if I work on fleshing those out
even when I don't have a lot of energy&#x2013;breaking things down into
points, and organizing several notes into larger chunks&#x2013;that should
help me become more used to outlines.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tags</b>
</p>

<p>
In addition to organizing notes in outlines, you can also use tags.
Tags go on the ends of headings, like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-level-2">** Heading title     :tag:another-tag:</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can filter headings by tags using <code>M-x org-match-sparse-tree</code>
(<code>C-c \</code>) or <code>M-x org-tags-view</code> (<code>C-c a m</code>).
</p>

<p>
Tags are interesting as a way to search for or filter out
combinations. I used tags a lot more before, when I was using them for
GTD contexts. I don't use them as much now, although I've started
tagging recipes by main ingredient and cooking method. (Hmm, maybe I
should try visualizing things as a table&#x2026;) I also use tags to post
entries under Wordpress blog categories.
</p>

<p>
How can I get better at using tags? I can look for things that don't
lend themselves well to outlines, but have several dimensions that I
may want to browse or search by. That's probably going to be recipe
management for now. If I figure out a neat way to add tags to my
datetree journal notes and then visualize them, that might be cool
too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Links</b>
</p>

<p>
Org Mode links allow me to refer not only to web pages, files,
headings, and text searches, but to things like documentation or even
executable code. When I find myself jumping between places a lot, I
tend to build links so that I don't have to remember what to jump to.
My <a href="http://sachachua.com/evil-plans">evil plans Org Mode file</a> uses links to create and visualize
structure, so that's pretty cool, too. But there's still a lot more
that I could probably do with this.
</p>

<p>
How can I use links more effectively? I can link to more types of
things, such as Lisp code. I can go back over my book notes and fill
in the citation graph out of curiosity. Come to think of it, I could
do that with my writing as well. My writing ideas rarely fit in neat
outlines. I often feel like I'm combining multiple threads, and links
could help me see those connections.
</p>

<p>
In addition to explicit links, I can also define "radio targets" that
turn any instance of that text into a hyperlink back to that location.
Only seems to work within a single file, though, and I've never
actually used this feature for something yet.
</p>

<p>
<b>Properties</b>
</p>

<p>
You can set various properties for your Org Mode subtrees and then
display those properties in columns or filter your subtrees by those
properties. I've used <code>Effort</code> to keep track of effort estimates and I
have some agenda commands that use that. I also use a custom
<code>Quantified</code> property to make it easier to clock into tasks using <a href="http://quantifiedawesome.com/">my
Quantified Awesome system</a>.
</p>

<p>
I could track energy level as either tags or properties. Properties
allow for easier sorting, I think. Can I define a custom sort order,
or do I have to stick with numeric codes? Yeah, I can sort by a custom
function, so I can come up with my own thing. Okay. That suggests a
way I can learn to use properties more effectively.
</p>

<p>
There are even more ways to organize Org Mode notes in Emacs (agenda
views, exports, etc.), but the ones above look like good things to
focus on. So much to try and learn!

<p>
I spent some time working on upgrading Quantified Awesome from Rails 3
to Rails 4. I was so glad that I had invested the time into writing
enough RSpec and Cucumber tests to cover all the code, since that
flushed out a lot of the differences between versions: deprecated
methods, strong parameters, and so on.
</p>

<p>
<code>rspec-mode</code> was really helpful while testing upgrade-related changes.
I quickly got into the habit of using <code>C-c , m</code>
(<code>rspec-verify-matching</code>) to run the spec file related to the current
file. If I needed to test specific things, I headed over to the spec
file and used <code>C-c , s</code> (<code>rspec-verify-single</code>). Because RSpec had
also changed a little bit, I needed to change the way
<code>rspec-verify-single</code> worked.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">sacha/rspec-verify-single</span> ()
  <span class="org-doc">"Runs the specified example at the point of the current buffer."</span>
  (interactive)
  (rspec-run-single-file
   (concat
     (rspec-spec-file-for (buffer-file-name))
     <span class="org-string">":"</span>
     (<span class="org-keyword">save-restriction</span>
               (widen)
               (number-to-string (line-number-at-pos))))
   (rspec-core-options)))

(sacha/package-install 'rspec-mode)
(<span class="org-keyword">use-package</span> <span class="org-constant">rspec-mode</span>
  <span class="org-builtin">:config</span>
  (<span class="org-keyword">progn</span>
    (setq rspec-command-options <span class="org-string">"--fail-fast --color"</span>)
    (fset 'rspec-verify-single 'sacha/rspec-verify-single)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>C-c , c</code> (<code>rspec-verify-continue</code>) was also a handy function,
especially with an <code>.rspec</code> containing the <code>--color --fail-fast</code>
options. <code>rspec-verify-continue</code> starts from the current test and runs
other tests following it, so you don't have to re-run the tests that
worked until you're ready for everything.
</p>

<p>
I should probably get back to setting up Guard so that the tests are automatically re-run whenever I save files, but this is a good start.
Also, yay, I'm back to all the tests working!
</p>

<p>
Test coverage didn't mean I could avoid all the problems, though. I hadn't properly frozen the versions in my Gemfile or checked the asset pipeline. When I deployed to my webserver, I ran into problems with incompatible changes between Rails 4.0 and 4.1, and Bootstrap 2 and Bootstrap 3. Whoops! Now I'm trying to figure out how to get formtastic-bootstrap to play nicely with Bootstrap 3 and Rails 4 and the latest Formtastic&#x2026; There are some git repositories that claim to do this correctly, but they don't seem to work.
</p>

<p>
Grr.
</p>

<p>
Fine, I'll switch to <code>simple_form</code>, since that seems to be sort of okay with Bootstrap 3. I ended up using this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tokenvolt/6599141">simple_form_bootstrap3 initializer</a> along with
</p>

<pre class="example">
# You can wrap a collection of radio/check boxes in a pre-defined tag, defaulting to none.
config.collection_wrapper_tag = :div

# You can define the class to use on all collection wrappers. Defaulting to none.
config.collection_wrapper_class = 'collection'
</pre>

<p>
and this in my <code>style.css.sass</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sass"><span class="org-type">.form-horizontal</span>
  <span class="org-type">.control-group</span>
    <span class="org-keyword">@extend</span> .form-group
  <span class="org-type">.control-label</span>
    <span class="org-keyword">@extend</span> .col-sm-2
  <span class="org-type">.control-group</span> &gt; <span class="org-type">.form-control</span>, <span class="org-type">.form-group</span> &gt; <span class="org-type">.form-control</span>, <span class="org-type">.form-group</span> &gt; <span class="org-type">.collection</span>
    <span class="org-keyword">@extend</span> .col-sm-10
  <span class="org-type">.help-block</span>
    <span class="org-keyword">@extend</span> .col-sm-offset-2
  <span class="org-type">.control-label.boolean</span>
    <span class="org-variable-name">text-align:</span> left
    <span class="org-variable-name">font-weight:</span> normal
    <span class="org-keyword">@extend</span> .col-sm-offset-2
  label<span class="org-type">.radio</span>
    <span class="org-variable-name">font-weight:</span> normal
</pre>
</div>

<p>
which is totally a hack, but it sort-of-semi-works for now.
</p>

<p>
More changes to come, since I've got to get it sorted out for Rails 4.1 too! Mrph.

<p>
I screwed up my self-hosted Wordpress blog three ways in one evening.
</p>

<p>
First, I had an infinite loop thanks to Display Post Shortcode and <code>include_content</code> in a post that had the same tag that I was looking for. Right. Don't do that. Remember to remove <code>include_content</code> or exclude the post right before publishing.
</p>

<p>
Then I published a post without checking <i>several times</i> that my site was still up. I checked twice, which was apparently not enough. I should probably check five times. Or ten. Or at least a few times after restarting PHP. Since I hadn't checked, I spent a couple of hours playing a video game with W- instead of, say, stressing out about my site. Could've solved the problem sooner.
</p>

<p>
And then when I stressed out about my site, I "fixed it" in entirely the wrong way. I <i>reduced</i> <code>php5-fpm</code>'s <code>max_children</code> instead of increasing it. This made it worse.
</p>

<p>
I had been worrying about running out of memory when I should've been worrying about running out of processes.
</p>

<p>
I felt that panic-induced haze setting in, scrambling through Google and adding all sorts of bits to my config, ripping out all sorts of plugins, and wondering how I could get a coredump. When I noticed I was making things worse, I made myself stop. I took a deep breath, and started untangling what was going on. I tried the opposite of what I had been trying. That worked.
</p>

<p>
Good timing, actually. Well, it could have been better timing, but that's one of the nice things about minimizing commitments and making good stuff for free; it lowers the risk of trying things out and learning something new.
</p>

<p>
I'm still getting SIGSEGV errors. It happens even if there are few active server processes. But at least it's sporadic instead of constant, and 1:59 AM is not the best time to dig into something like that. After sleep and reading, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
I'm a little bit nervous about my setup, and I'll probably set aside some time this week to dig into system administration and build my skills. I really should have a good plan for downtime, and a better plan for learning the essentials outside of a fire. But mistakes are great because they show you multiple holes in your system, so this is not too bad. Better now than when I'm managing a client site.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, I did have the presence of mind to temporarily redirect sach.ac to the static URL, switching it back after the PHP issues seemed to have cleared. Good strategy. Should do that first in the future.
</p>

<p>
With any luck, the blog is still up today. If you're reading this, yay!
</p>

<p>
I'm still happy that I self-host, even if I make mistakes like this. =) Good time to make mistakes and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
So, what am I going to change for next time?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prepare a contingency plan for Stuff Happening, possibly involving throwing up a quick maintenance page that collects e-mails so that I can send abject apologies and link updates. Make this static so that it loads quickly, and have an external copy (ex: Dropbox) just in case my server is down and I have to redirect at the domain level.
</li>
<li>Check several times after restarting PHP. Just because it loads once doesn't mean it's going to load again.
</li>
<li>Consider redirecting URLs to static sketchnotes or external pages. Links and comments are nice, but viewing is essential.
</li>
<li>Start <code>screen</code> right away instead of trying to juggle different commands. Set up logs and go to different configuration directories in order to minimize typing.
</li>
<li>Don't panic. Yes, website failures are embarrassing, but the nice thing about making this a gift is that I don't have to worry about racking up the business losses. When I notice that I'm panicking (making wild guesses in terms of changes, for example), I should slow down and remind myself that This Is Not The End of The World.
</li>
</ul>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-490">
<p>
We have a computer downstairs with backups of files, and I've been using it to explore Vagrant and development using virtual machines as well. It can be useful to be able to SSH into it from outside our network, so I spent some time setting up a dynamic domain name, port forwarding, and new limits for the SSH server.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> (the domain name registrar that I use) supports dynamic domains, so it was easy to enable.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Enable dynamic domains: <b>Manage Domains</b>, choose the domain, and then choose <b>Dynamic DNS</b>. Enable it and copy the password.
</li>
<li>Create an A record: Choose <b>All Records</b> and add a subdomain with a temporary address (ex: 127.0.0.1) and type <b>A</b>. Save the settings.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Our router uses the <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato firmware</a>, which has built-in support for Namecheap and other dynamic DNS provider.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Click on <b>Basic</b> - <b>DDNS</b>.
</li>
<li>Fill in the details for <b>Dynamic DNS 1</b>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Before I forwarded the ports, I wanted to make sure that SSH permitted password authentication on our local network but required passphrases for external connections. <a href="http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/818">OpenSSH: requiring keys, but allow passwords from some locations</a> (Michael W. Lucas) was really helpful. I edited <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, set <code>PasswordAuthentication no</code>, and added the following lines to the end of the file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Match Address 192.168.0.0/16
  PasswordAuthentication yes
</pre>

<p>
(I had some problems in the beginning because I typed this as <code>Yes</code> instead of <code>yes</code>&#x2026; Case matters!)
</p>

<p>
I restarted the SSH server with <code>service ssh restart</code> and confirmed that I could still SSH in.
</p>

<p>
Back to Tomato. <b>Port Forwarding</b> lets you set up forwarding rules. The port for SSH is 22, so I filled in a row with the port I wanted, the internal port, and the internal IP address of the server. I clicked <b>Save</b> (forgot to do this a few times because the button was near the end of the page) and that was that.
</p>

<p>
On Windows, I walked W- through generating a DSA public key with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuttyGEN</a>, loading it in <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">Pageant</a>, and copying it to his <code>.ssh/authorized_keys2</code> file.
</p>

<p>
Posting this here because I'm probably going to want to do this again someday, and it took some searching around. Besides, someone might find it handy!

<p>
Mark suggested that I put together some tips for Quantified Self. I
think that it might be good to put together a mini-guide on how to
take small steps and learn from them. This is not new advice, but
considering the obstacles and excuses I frequently hear from people
("I don't know where to start"; "I get discouraged"; "I never stick
with things"; "I don't know how to analyze data"), there might still
be a need for it.
</p>

<p>
Here's how I got to that conclusion. First, I thought about some of
the ideas Mark suggested.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16264638301/">2015.01.12 Considering ideas for QS mini-guide &#x2013; index card #quantified #planning</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to run personal experiments: formulating small, testable hypotheses; researching ideas; collecting data; analyzing data (and minimizing errors); figuring out the next step
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Useful for people who want to try something new, but many people will find this intimidating and they'll benefit from getting started with easier frameworks like pre-built apps
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Small wins: small things to measure/try, setting yourself up for success, celebrating progress
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Useful for people who are being blocked by their excuses. Probably the most practical (and personally interesting for me).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mindset shifts for Quantified Self: experiments, curiosity, testing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Possibly interesting, but needs to be translated into practical action
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why track: benefits, working around limits, learning more
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People who aren't open to the idea won't be convinced quickly. People who are into it don't need to be sold on it. Are there people on the fence?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Okay. Small wins. Actually, small steps, since we may want to play
around with the definition of a win anyway.
</p>

<p>
I jotted down some ideas and started connecting them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15644037204/">2015.01.12 Quantified Self and small steps &#x2013; index card #quantified</a>
</p>

<p>
If I put together a guide, I could synthesize insights from the following books:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>The Power of Habit</i> (Duhigg, 2012): the habit loop, triggers, rewards, and replacing habits
</li>
<li><i>The Progress Principle</i> (Amabile and Kramer, 2011): small wins, daily progress on meaningful tasks, and how to nourish and catalyze
</li>
<li><i>The Inner Game of Work</i> (Gallwey, 2001): nonjudgmental awareness
</li>
<li>Either <i>The 4-Hour Chef</i> (Ferriss, 2012) or <i>The First 20 Hours</i> (Kaufman, 2013): breaking down skills and changes
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oh! There are also some books and resources about tiny habits, mini habits, or micro habits. I vaguely remember reading a paperback book from the library on the same topic some years ago, but it's not in my book notes. Hmm.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the key points from these books and other research I've come across, though, what else can I add to the conversation? I prefer not to write something already capably expressed somewhere else. It makes more sense to link to that and then build up from there. So, if I'm going to spend time and attention on this, what can I bring to it, and what do I want to get out of it?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm not an expert in improving my habits, but paying attention to the details and analyzing my successes/failures can help me grow.
</li>
<li>I've learned something from consistently blogging and from doing regular weekly/monthly/yearly reviews for years. I've also learned something from the small decisions of my opportunity fund, figuring out productivity advice that works for me, and reducing energy I used to waste in being frustrated or self-recrimination.
</li>
<li>If I write small chunks of research, insights, and tips related to the key excuses, I'll have a resource that I can share the next time I hear those excuses get in someone's way.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As I wrote down my thoughts related to taking small steps, I got clearer on the challenges people face and the excuses that get in our way.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16078924888/">2015.01.12 More thoughts about QS mini-guide &#x2013; index card #quantified #planning</a>
</p>

<p>
Despite the occasional exhortation to set audacious stretch goals (like registering for a marathon when you're more of a couch potato), I think most people understand the value of taking small steps and making small goals. Popular goals tend to be outcome-focused instead of process-focused; I find process-focused goals to be better for me, and research tends to say the same too. So that's something more people can benefit from learning about. (Ooh, possibly interesting research to explore: <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17405620801969585#.VLQ8CSvF98E">age-related differences and positive effects for process focus</a>; <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/89/1/29/">shifting from process to outcome</a>, <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/JEXE.72.4.269-287">self-regulated learners</a>, etc.) Also, people tend to give up without realizing that they can get value from even very short, simple experiments. They get discouraged by noise and lack of progress.
</p>

<p>
I've learned that it helps to start by building awareness (without
being overly judgmental). That will help you come up with tiny tweaks.
As you learn from the experiment-, you can absorb some changes into
your daily routines.
</p>

<p>
That suggests a structure for this potential mini-guide on Quantified
Self and small steps:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15644036274/">2015.01.12 Structure for QS mini-guide on small steps &#x2013; index card #quantified</a>
</p>

<p>
If I can connect with the excuses that people often get stuck at and address them with a few practical tips, that might help people move from feeling overwhelmed (or casually dismissive) to feeling that there might be something worthwhile that they can try.
</p>

<p>
What will this guide look and feel like?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16080590907/">2015.01.12 What will this QS guide look and feel like &#x2013; index card #quantified #planning</a>
</p>

<p>
Ideally, I'd be able to condense the key tips onto a single page, like
the one-page summary of <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/02/excuses-guide-blogging-pdf-epub-mobi-free-also-notes-publishing/">A No-Excuses Guide to Blogging</a>. Since the tips
would be more effective with research, examples, and links, it makes
sense to flesh them out into a blog post with illustrations. There's
probably enough material for more detailed blog posts for each of the
excuses or stages. How about a presentation? Blog posts are quicker to
put together or break apart for linking, but a short presentation with
links might be worth creating because it's easy to share.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I'll get all the way to that point in one week, though.
=) I can probably quickly sketch out my thoughts. I might be able to
back up a few points with research. I don't feel that I can speak
authoritatively about it yet, but if I prioritize the excuses I want
to address, I might be able to find things that will help dislodge
people and get them going.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. Possibly interesting?

I'm having this odd mental tangle around trying to frame my plans as though they were the plans of a corporation, a non-profit, or even a conglomerate. It's a strange thing and I'm looking forward to digging into it further. Something about non-transactional models, exploration, long-term views, tribes instead of markets or audiences&#x2026; I suspect my current metaphor might be closer to science than it is to business, with a dash of music thrown in. Not that this explanation makes sense, but I think it will if I explore it a bit further. Thanks for the nudge to think about it!

The point of scenario planning, after all, is not to be right, which
is such a human inclination that we find it hard to overcome—the point
of scenario planning is to see the future from perspectives we would
have a difficult time forcing ourselves to imagine because of our bias
toward rightness, and therefore imagine new possibilities or see
threats we might otherwise miss.
The trick is to know we will always be wrong as we speculate about the
future

<p>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/scenarios/build.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/scenarios/build.html</a>
Yet, the purpose of scenario planning is not to pinpoint future events
but to highlight large-scale forces that push the future in different
directions. It's about making these forces visible, so that if they do
happen, the planner will at least recognize them. It's about helping
make better decisions today.

<p>
It's been a little over half a year since I <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/02/decision-update-hacklab-to/">signed up for a membership at HackLab</a>, a makerspace and coworking area in Kensington Market.
Before I signed up, I thought about the things I would like to be true at the evaluation point for my experiment, which I set at nine months after I signed up (so November 2013). I figured it would be good to do a quick check so that I can adjust things. Here's what I wrote in February, and how it has matched up so far with my experience:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>I know more about other geeks in Toronto thanks to ambient conversations and helping each other out</dt><dd>HackLab is full of interesting people. I like dropping by and hanging out at the open houses or during regular days.
</dd>
<dt>I’m better at asking people for help when I get stuck, and at setting myself tougher challenges knowing that people can help</dt><dd>I've done this a couple of times (keyboard layouts, business questions, web stuff, system administration), although I still need to work on that.
</dd>
<dt>I’ve dug into some of the more difficult things that are easier to learn with other people who can help me. For example: web development, mobile development, electronics</dt><dd>Web development and system administration might be good things to focus on. There are lots f other people who are working on similar things.
</dd>
<dt>I’ve gotten better at sketching ideas, asking other people for feedback, and fleshing out the ones that get people interested</dt><dd>I drew How to Learn Emacs while I was at HackLab. That was fun. =) I've drawn some of the sketchnote lessons here, too.
</dd>
<dt>I’ve improved serendipity (test different laptop cues to talk? talk to people about what they’re working on?)</dt><dd>Overhearing stuff works well.
</dd>
<dt>I go to HackLab 1-2 times a week, and sometimes more often if the weather is great.</dt><dd>See analysis below
</dd>
<dt>I’m good at managing my focus (do not disturb / yes, talk to me)</dt><dd>Background conversations interfere with things like typing practice (Plover/Colemak), but I'm okay with listening to conversations while typing (Dvorak), coding, or drawing. Headphones help a little.
</dd>
<dt>I’m good at talking to new people and hanging out with the regulars</dt><dd>Getting there. I feel comfortable around HackLab members and I often have interesting conversations at open houses, particularly over food.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In general, the benefits I'm looking for are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ambient socialization with interesting people
</li>
<li>Ambient exposure to interesting things
</li>
<li>Possible support for learning stuff (ex: Javascript, system administration, Haskell, Python, neural nets, hardware, electronics, 3D printing)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
My initial goal was to go to HackLab 1-2 times a week. As of 2013-09-25 (~31 weeks after I joined; I was doing this analysis before the members' meeting), I have been to HackLab on 41 distinct days. This is within my target range of 31 to 62 visits, and works out to 1.3 visits a week. This is a pleasant surprise, because I started this analysis thinking that I was underusing my HackLab membership compared to my goals. Based on my current attendance, this costs a little less than $10 per visit, which is worth the awesome vegan cooking opportunities / lessons / dinners (Tuesday open houses) and overheard conversations with interesting geeks.
</p>

<p>
I'm at 66% of the top part of my goal range. What are my current limiting factors, and how can I work around them?
</p>

<p>
Inertia is powerful and works ways: when I'm home, it's easy to stay home; when I'm in the middle of working on something interesting on the kitchen table, I don't want to pack up and bike over. I often sleep in during my non-consulting days, and sometimes I think: "Is it really worth biking downtown for a few hours of hanging out or working?" I've also offered to do a couple of extra half-days of consulting each week during September and October, so that limits the number of days when it makes sense to go to HackLab. Besides, introvert mode is pretty comfortable - no distracting conversations, and plenty of good food in the fridge.
</p>

<p>
So, what could help me make even better use of HackLab? How can I hack my motivation and reward structure to get me out the door?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Commit to the exercise and treat HackLab as a bonus.</b> At least once a week (Fridays), I will bike for at least 1.5 hours including a mailbox check. I might as well use that biking time to end up at Hacklab, do some stuff, and then take the other 45 minutes on the way back.
</li>
<li><b>Make Hacklab the centre of my socialization.</b> Instead of setting up separate get-togethers with people, I will funnel people to HackLab's open house (which I will attend whenever I don't have other events). If I'm in introvert mode, I will treat the open house as cooking lessons, catch up with people briefly, and relax knowing that people can always chat with other people. If I'm in socialization mode, I will catch up with people.
</li>
<li><b>Consider small-scale cooking on regular days.</b> Have fun by cooking at HackLab even on non-open house days: merienda? This might be easier once we've moved to the new location, with a larger kitchen and a non-drinks fridge.
</li>
<li><b>On HackLab days, do not open the computer at home in the morning.</b> This gets around the momentum issue. Checking things on the phone is okay, as is working on the computer if something urgent comes up.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>What about winter?</b> I'm going to face some motivation challenges when snow makes biking more dangerous and the cold encourages me to stay home. On mild days in winter, I might be able to bike down or TTC down. I can use that as a context switch to write or code. Is it worth $6 to take the TTC down here at least once a week, bringing it to a total cost of $16 or so? Maybe, especially if I move things around so that I'm at HackLab instead of consulting on Tuesdays (or I work remotely on Tuesdays). If I discount winter and consider my membership based solely on my attendance so far, it works out to roughly $15 per day, which is still worth it considering other co-working spaces are $20 for a day pass and don't offer 24h access, not that I've been here at 3 AM. Besides, HackLab does cool things. So yes, I'll continue throughout winter, and I'll see if I can get past the activation costs of getting down here by TTC. (Reading time on the subway/streetcar, and travelling during off-peak hours?)
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, here are the queries that I used to check how many times I've been in HackLab:

<p>
In the process of experimenting with different types of businesses,
I've been learning a lot about different types of commitments. There's
a spectrum of commitment-hardness, from very hard (take a loss if you
have to, but Make This Happen) to very soft (it's nice to have, but no
big deal if it doesn't work out).
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a very hard commitment is speaking.</b> If I commit to
giving a talk at event, I need to prepare the talk, and I need to be
there. Doesn't matter if I have a cold. Doesn't matter if I'm running
late because of another meeting and have to hop into a cab. Doesn't
matter if I'm feeling out of it. I need to show up and be
professional, which means energy and connection. I can collapse
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a hard commitment is sketchnoting an event.</b> I promise
to be at the event on a certain date, and if I miss that, the
opportunity is gone forever. It's not as big a deal as speaking, since
sketchnoting is usually an extra. I write my agreements so that I'm
only responsible for refunding the client's payment if something falls
through instead of being liable for loss of business or other costs.
I've never had to invoke this clause, but I've turned down gigs because of uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a medium commitment is freelance development.</b> If I'm
working with other developers, then I usually need to work at specific
times or at a specific pace, but there's often some leeway in what I
can do and when.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conversations are also medium commitments.</b> They're scheduled in the
calendar, but we can reschedule if necessary.
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a softer commitment is illustration.</b> Someone is
counting on the images, and sometimes there's a deadline. I'm free to
do the work at a time of my choosing, though, aside from the
occasional meetings that are more like hard commitments.
</p>

<p>
<b>The kind of consulting I've settled into is another example of a soft
commitment.</b> I have a few meetings (usually mid-day or early
afternoon), but I have a lot of flexibility in terms of how many hours
I work each week. We keep a long, prioritized list of things to work
on, so I can usually choose what I want to work on at a particular
time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Writing is a very soft commitment.</b> No one cares when I do it, so I
can write whenever I want. I can write a whole bunch of posts in one
day and spread them out for consistency and variety. I can slowly
accumulate thoughts or resources for books. I care about writing at
least a little bit each week, but that push comes from me.
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, compensation isn't always proportional to the hardness
of the commitment. Most of it has to do with the underlying skills
rather than how strict the commitment is.
</p>

<p>
I vastly prefer softer commitments over harder ones. Some of the
things I'm working on have unpredictable schedules, and I'd rather be
able to reschedule or move things around if something comes up. I
minimize the number of hard commitments (business or personal) I need
to plan for, and keep a stock of soft commitments that help me take
advantage of spare moments. Soft commitments make it easier to match
interest or energy with choice of activity, so it's easier to focus
and get things done.
</p>

<p>
I've been taking on fewer events, working on consulting and writing
instead. After all, if I can get away with it, why not work with less
stress and more happiness? =)

"What should I do with my life?"
</p>

<p>
When you have the freedom to set your own TO-DO list, it can be
difficult to decide what goes on it. Should you focus on one project
or juggle a few? Why one goal instead of another? How much time should
you spend on something new, and how much time on polishing something
old?
</p>

<p>
It's easy to get stuck in rumination. You can end up spending so much
time and mental energy worrying about what you should do with your
life that you don't actually get things done.
</p>

<p>
Here are some things I'm learning about learning from constant
progress and setting limits on second-guessing.
</p>

<p>
<b>I keep a list of tasks that I can work on</b> even when I feel the twinges
of doubt. I organize this by project and type of task. For example, I
feel like coding, I can quickly pick a task related to that. This
means that if I don't feel inspired, I can trust that the Sacha who
made this list came up with tasks that would be a pretty good use of
my time. It might not be the best use, but it won't be a complete
waste either. These unscheduled tasks give me a baseline of
productivity. If I don't want to work on something, I have to justify
that by coming up with another task that would be even better.
</p>

<p>
For example, I know that I will generally get good value out of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>writing 1,000 to 2,000 words to answer a question or help people
learn more
</li>
<li>learning more about a specific programming language or platform by
reading tutorials, source code, or blog posts, by working through
tutorials, or by coding
</li>
<li>writing tests and code
</li>
<li>sketchnoting a video or book
</li>
<li>exercising or cooking
</li>
<li>braindumping thoughts
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You probably have a list like that too: types of tasks that tend to
work well for you, especially if they leave you feeling awesome.
</p>

<p>
Even a good list of tasks wouldn't help much if I'm switching projects
all the time. I'd keep getting started on different things, with very
little to show for it. To deal with this second-guessing, I try to
<b>publish or share things as early as possible.</b> That way, even if I
switch focus, my notes are out there for other people to build on.
This also opens it up for feedback and appreciation, which is great
for encouraging me to work on something even more.
</p>

<p>
I also limit <i>when</i> I plan. During the week, I might decide to focus
more on one project instead of another, but I don't dump all my
previous projects. If I come up with an idea I'm curious about, I add
it to my list for later review. Every month, I look at my goals and
evaluate my projects, checking which ones are still relevant. Every
year, I look at my values and evaluate my goals.
</p>

<p>
When I catch myself procrastinating a task, I often use that as an
opportunity to evaluate my projects and goals as well. Am I
procrastinating because other projects have become more important?
Great, I can replace the task with one for a higher-priority project.
On the other hand, am I procrastinating because I overvalue immediate
rewards over my long-term goals? The project/goal review reminds me
why something matters and helps me get back on track. I don't spend a
lot of time thinking about whether I should come up with new projects
instead. The time for that is when I review my goals and plan my
month, not when I feel like procrastinating things.
</p>

<p>
Another thing that helps me box in my tendency to over-plan is
reminding myself that I'm not trying to decide the absolute best thing
to do with my time. Good enough is good enough. If I move forward,
even if it's not <b>quite</b> optimal, I can learn more than I would
standing still. If I feel I'm slightly off-track, that can teach me
about where the track is.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="optimal.png" alt="optimal.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So it's worth spending a little time making sure I'm pointed in
roughly the right direction, but it might not make to spend four hours
trying to figure out how I can get 100% instead of 80% value out of an
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
It's good to periodically check if I'm going the right way. I'm
probably doing okay if:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can tell how I'm different or what I learn week to week, month to month
</li>
<li>My projects include several things that excite me, and I'm learning from my experiences working on different tasks
</li>
<li>Other people tell me that what I share or work on is useful
</li>
<li>Things build up; scale or network effects happen
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If those are true, then I'm probably not wasting my time. I might even
be able to get away without worrying about better ways at all. I can
wait for people to suggest better ways to spend my time, and I can
listen for suggestions that resonate with me.
</p>

<p>
What do you do to avoid getting stuck in the question "What should I
do with my life?"

"What tools should I buy?" "What platform do I start with?" "What's
the best option out there?" Geeks have a special case of analysis
paralysis at the beginning of things. We try to optimize that first
step, and instead end up never getting started.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I'm learning: <b>In the beginning, you're unlikely to be
able to appreciate the sophisticated differences between tools.</b> Don't
bother spending hours or days or weeks picking the perfect tool for
you. Sure, you can do a little bit of research, but then <b>pick one and
learn with that first.</b> If you run into the limits, <i>that's</i> when you
can think about upgrading.
</p>

<p>
<b>Start with something simple and inexpensive (or even free).</b> If you
wear it out or if you run into things you just can't do with it and
that are worth the additional expense, then decide if you want to get
something better. I do this with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Food: We start with inexpensive ingredients and work our way up as necessary.
</li>
<li>Shoes: Upgraded from cheap to medium.
</li>
<li>Bicycles: Still on the first bicycle I bought in Canada, since it was enough for me.
</li>
<li>Ukeleles: Glad I just bought the basic one, since it turns out it's not quite my thing.
</li>
<li>Knives: Okay, we splurged on this one and started with good knives,
since I piggybacked off W-'s experience and recommendations.
</li>
<li>Drawing: I tried the Nintendo DS before upgrading to a tablet and
then to a tablet PC. For paper, I tried ordinary sketchbooks that
cost $4.99 on sale, and have been happy with them so far - although
I might downgrade to just having a binder of loose sheets.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Don't worry about what the "best" is until you figure out what your
actual needs are.</b>
</p>

<p>
There are situations in which the cheapest or the simplest might not
be the best place to start. You can easily get frustrated if something
is not well-designed, and some inferior tools like dull kitchen knives
are dangerous. That's a sign that you've run into your choice's limits
and can therefore upgrade without worry. Yes, it might waste a little
money and time, but you'll probably waste even more time if you
procrastinate choosing (more research! more!) and waste more money if
you always buy things that have more capacity than you ultimately
need. You can tweak how you make that initial decision&#x2013;maybe always
consider the second-from-the-bottom or something like that&#x2013;but the
important part is <b>getting out there and learning.</b>

</p>

<p>
Now that I've set up my Org agenda commands to easily review
unscheduled tasks, I've been cutting down on the number of tasks I
schedule during my weekly review. I'm still in the habit of checking
my projects and scheduling at least one task for each of them, so that
I make sure to think about those projects at least twice during the
week&#x2013;during my weekly review, and then again when I do (or
procrastinate!) that week's project task.
</p>

<p>
Is it time to tweak that? Hmm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What would it be like to schedule fewer tasks and pick more from my project list?
</p>

<p>
Possible negative outcomes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I focus too much on work because the TODOs there are clearer
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Getting pretty good at working on personal projects, actually.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I focus too much on routine tasks because things aren't scheduled
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No, I'm doing pretty okay at finishing my routine tasks and picking interesting things to work on
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I neglect some projects because I'm focused on others.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is not too bad, actually, because things that don't get done are usually less important anyway.
</li>
<li>On the other hand, just because I like working on some things in
the short term doesn't mean I shouldn't keep making steady
progress on other tasks.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Possible positive outcomes:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I procrastinate less (and feel less guilty about procrastinating) because things aren't scheduled
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The tasks that I procrastinate tend to be associated with projects
that I don't care about as much as the projects I'm focused on.
So, if I don't schedule them but I review the project list when
I'm looking for something to work on, I could get a better
picture.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do sprints when it comes to projects, so I build up momentum.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmm. Maybe that's something I can try - going back to the schedule as
a reflection of commitments instead of mixing commitments and
intentions.
</p>

<p>
Oh. There's an interesting idea there. Commitments and intentions.
</p>

<p>
I like leaving lots of space in my schedule. It feels good to cross
tasks off, and it feels good to get even more done than I had planned.
If I plan less, is that just artificially increasing my satisfaction?
If I reduce the friction from moving tasks around, will that smooth
the way for even more awesomeness, or am I just giving in? Hmm. What
test can I use to tell the difference?
</p>

<p>
Hypothesis: If I schedule fewer tasks, I will still manage to make
good progress on projects that are important to me. No, that's still
not quite testable. What are the specific warning signs that would
make me feel like I'm spending my time less effectively than before?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I identify missed opportunities that I would've retrospectively preferred.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's backtrack, clarify&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Right now, I notice that I reschedule some tasks - sometimes multiple times. I do this because:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The task is probably useful, but not a priority. For example: redesigning business cards
</li>
<li>The task is for one of my projects, but I'm focused on other projects at the moment.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ex: box cover cushion - current system sorta works, and I don't get a lot of enjoyment out of sewing. However, it would be good to finish that, I guess.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When I postpone a task, I feel a momentary doubt, a lessening of myself. Yes, it's because I choose to work on other things. But it also means that I and my past self disagree about how to spend my time, even if my past self makes only the slightest of suggestions and never means to guilt-trip. So, should my past self (actually my current self, planning a week in advance) still make suggestions? In which situations are past-self decisions more useful than present ones?
</p>

<p>
I know that present-self Sacha tends to over-value immediate consequences compared to future ones, based on psychology research. This manifests as a desire to work on fun things instead of, say, things that are longer-term but still useful.
</p>

<p>
Past-self Sacha doesn't ask much. Ten projects, 8-10 scheduled tasks, thirty minutes to an hour each. That's still between half a day to a day that's spoken for. Most of it gets done. Other things, I end up going "meh."
</p>

<p>
Hmm. Maybe I should just mark those projects as non-current. How do I really feel about the projects I keep postponing?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Delegation: process library
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm not particularly interested in broadening my delegation, but maybe more like going deeper. So we're fine where we are, I think. Although thinking about what I can delegate might bring up other possibilities, which would be good because the team I have could use more work. Or really, I can try dreaming bigger dreams.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sketchnoting books: I'm pretty meh about books these days. Why? Mm, other people's content, and I feel like it's iffy.
</li>
<li>Emacs Basics: Seems like other things are more useful at the moment, such as organizing the content out there.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think what's happening is that I've kept these projects on my list just in case, but really, I care less about them than I care about other projects. So I should update my project list.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. What if I prioritized my project list? So I do regularly review things, but some things are higher priority than others. I commit to doing at least one task each week for my top-priority projects.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the actual blog post in this?

<p>
Thanks to gardening and working on other personal projects, I'm
learning how to live one day at a time. Or at least, how to combine my
usual scenario-based planning with the acceptance that I can't plan
ahead or control some things. I pick leafminer eggs off the sorrel and
flower buds off the lettuce, I water (unless it's rained), and I wait.
Can't speed it up. The season will pass soon enough. Can't really slow
it down, either. I just have to check the boxes day by day.
</p>

<p>
I mostly live in a mix of the future and the present. Part of me lives
in the future that I'm saving and investing for, occasionally checking
how the possibilities change. Part of me is learning to live
</p>

<p>
And then there's sideways: the time I spend playing games or reading
fiction. It's neither here nor there.
</p>

<p>
The past surfaces in in-jokes, but I don't spend much time in
it aside from the occasional review where I notice

There's power in constant progress, even if it's small. You can motivate yourself in different ways. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem%22">Don't break the chain"</a> is a popular model: keep track of the days that you work on something, count the number of consecutive days in your current streak, and eventually it will build up into a number that you're proud of. If you miss a day, you start back at 0. This works for a lot of people, but it's a bit harsher than I'd like.

</p>

<p>
With another Quantified Self Toronto meetup in a few weeks and a conversation with fellow self-trackers, it's time for me to think about time again.
</p>

<p>
I've been fixing bugs and adding small pieces of functionality to <a href="http://quantifiedawesome.com/">Quantified Awesome</a>, and I spent some time improving the integration with Emacs. Now I can type <code>!</code> to clock in on a task and update Quantified Awesome. Completing the task clocks me out in Emacs and updates Beeminder if appropriate. (I don't update Quantified Awesome when finishing a task, because I just clock into the next activity.) This allows me to take advantage of Org's clock reports for project and task-level time, at least for discretionary projects that involve my computer. I'm not going to get full coverage, but that's what Quantified Awesome's web interface is for. It takes very little effort to track things now, if I'm working off my to-do list. Even if I'm not, it still takes just a few taps on my phone to switch activities.
</p>

<p>
Most of my data is still medium-level, since I'm still getting the hang of sorting out my time in Emacs. Looking at data from 2014 so far, dropping partial weeks, and doing the analysis on April 14 (which is when I'm drafting this), here's what I've been finding.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I sleep a little more than I used to: an average of 8.9 hours a day, or 37% of the time. This is up from 8.3 hours last year.
</li>
<li>It takes me about an hour to get ready in the mornings. If I have a quick breakfast instead of having rice and fried egg, I can get out the door in 30-45 minutes.
</li>
<li>It takes me 50-60 minutes to get downtown, whether this is by transit or bicycle. Commuting takes 3% of my time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Little surprises:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I've spent almost twice as much time on business building or discretionary productive activities (19%) as I have earning (11%) - good to see <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/becoming-own-client/">decisions</a> in action!
</li>
<li>I've spent more time drawing than writing this year (5% vs 3%). Next to writing, Emacs is the productive discretionary activity I spend most of my time on (2%).
</li>
<li>I've spent 10% of my time this year on connecting with people, a surprisingly high number for me. E-mail takes 1% of my overall time.
</li>
<li>It turns out that yes, coding and drawing are negatively correlated (-0.63 considering all coding-related activities). But writing and drawing are positively correlated (0.44), which makes sense - I draw, and then I write a blog post to glue sketches together and give context. Earning is slightly negatively correlated with building business/skills (-0.15), but connecting is even more negatively correlated with time spent building business/skills (-0.35). So it's probably not that consulting takes me away from building skills. Sleep is slightly negatively correlated with all records related to socializing (-0.14), but strongly negatively correlated with productive discretionary activities (-0.55). Hmm. Something to tinker with.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some things I'm learning from tracking time on specific tasks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Outlining doubles the time I take to write (and drops me from about ~30wpm to about 9wpm), but I feel that it makes things more structured.
</li>
<li>Drawing takes longer too, but it makes blog posts more interesting.
</li>
<li>Trying to dictate posts takes me way more time than outlining or typing it, since I'm not as used to organizing my thoughts that way.
</li>
<li>Encoding litter box data takes me about a minute per data point. So spending a lot of time trying to figure out computer vision and image processing in order to partially automate the process doesn't strictly make sense, but I'm doing it out of curiosity.
</li>
<li>I generally overestimate the time I need for programming-related tasks, which is surprising. That could just be me padding my estimates to account for distractions or to make myself feel great, though.
</li>
<li>I generally underestimate the time I need to write, especially if I'm figuring things out along the way.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This post took me 1:20 to draft (including data analysis), although to be fair, part of that involved a detour checking electricity use for an unrelated question. =)

I've used Microsoft Excel's <code>SUMIF</code> function to conditionally add up

use cases and you want to sum the points for all the use cases with
priority 1. <code>SUMIFS</code> (Microsoft Excel 2007 and later) is even more
powerful - it allows you to specify multiple criteria.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-585">
<p>
Over a few months that we'd been tracking our grocery
spending, we spent an average of $375 each month on groceries (17%
meat, 14% fruit, 13% dairy, 11% vegetables, 7% poultry). With the two
of us and J- in the household (who usually spends weekends with her
mom), that works out to roughly 240 meals a month, or an average of
$1.88 per meal. Let's add another $1 to account for utilities,
cleaning supplies, and miscellaneous expenses, and round it off to a
total of $3/meal for materials + miscellaneous.
</p>

<p>
Between November 2, 2012 (which is when I started tracking
grocery-buying separately and somewhat reliably) and January 13, 2013,
my time logs show:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>44:50 cooking &#x2013; this doesn't include breakfast unless I'm putting together something special, as I often lump regular breakfasts with all the rest of my morning routines
</li>
<li>38:24 tidying &#x2013; let's assume that a third of that is related to cooking, so we'll use 12:48 as our number
</li>
<li>13:06 buying groceries
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Assuming that W- spends an equal amount of time doing the same (we
often cook together, and he sometimes cooks during the week while I'm
fine with having leftovers), that comes to an average of 2 hours a day
related to preparing food &#x2013; usually a weekend afternoon, and
occasional weekday cooking.
</p>

<p>
What do we get for that?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yummy, healthy food (well, usually)
</li>
<li>Couple-time while planning our week, buying groceries, chopping ingredients, and preparing dishes; might save us expensive relationship therapy time later on
</li>
<li>Many of our favourite meals practically any day we want them (especially as the nearby restaurants don't make these meals or don't sell them for the same cost)
</li>
<li>The satisfaction of learning new skills and new recipes
</li>
<li>Shared experiences and memories
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The replacement cost for our labour would probably be $15-25/hour,
which are the rates I see on Craigslist. Picking $20 as a reasonable
number and assuming optimistically that the person would be a drop-in
replacement, that's a replacement labour cost of ~$1,200 for the
privilege of having someone else shop for groceries, prepare food,
clean up. If we include the cost of materials and miscellaneous
expenses, that's around $8 a meal.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at selectively replacing parts of what we do. In a previous
analysis, I found my GroceryGateway bill was around 10% higher than
what it would have been at our neighbourhood supermarket, and in
addition, there's a $11.95 delivery fee. Assuming things worked out
perfectly and we could replace all our grocery shopping time (~11
hours a month), that would be like paying $85 to get 11 hours back, or
buying time at $8 an hour. Except it isn't really, because we'll still
walk two thirds of the way in order to get because we go to the
library.
</p>

<p>
If our time is valued at least at minimum wage for homeworkers in
Ontario ($11.28 / hour), then each meal has an labour cost of $3.64.
Add another $1 for utilities, cleaning supplies, and miscellaneous
costs, and that comes out to roughly $8 per meal (materials + labour +
production). This doesn't count the amortization of our investment in
knives, pans, and other tools.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>SCENARIO: Having our groceries delivered would save us 2
person-hours, although we would then have to make a separate library
trip: net gain 80-100 person-minutes, for a cost of roughly
$21/week ($16/hour).
</li>

<li>SCENARIO: Having SupperSolved assemble and deliver the meals (/ (+
304 45) (* 12 4.0)) - $7.27/meal, still needs cleanup; saves
roughly 11 hours.
</li>

<li>SCENARIO: Making the meal at SupperSolved: 2 hours + 1 hour walk +
$304 (/ 304 (* 12 4.0)) $6.33 plus time, still needs cleanup

My brain has been fuzzier than normal these days. I've been sleeping about the same amount of time, although I suppose that there have been more interruptions lately (early morning wake-ups, neighbourhood construction). But it is apparently A Thing, so I just have to work around it.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-588">
<p>
My days have regular rhythms, as yours probably do. In the
morning, I'm usually fresh and energetic. The afternoons are sometimes
a little slower, but they're often solidly productive. In the
evenings, my mind is a bit tired, but it's a good time to catch up on
chores.
</p>

<p>
I'm slowly learning about the quirks of my rhythms and choices. I've
been thinking about what's good to do when so that I can find better
ways to use my time.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If I commute off-peak, I can sit down and write or play games. It's
easy to time this in the mornings. I often plan to avoid the evening
rush, but I get stuck in it anyway. This is because I get distracted
by cool things to work on or learn. Maybe I should set an alarm.
</li>

<li>If I sit on the couch, one of the cats will usually settle onto my
lap. This makes typing on a laptop inconvenient. But I enjoy
spending time with the cats, so I don't mind giving up a little
productivity. It's relaxing to focus on the cat instead of
multitasking, and sometimes ideas float into my head. When I want to
work on something, my phone can be more convenient than my laptop.
</li>

<li>If I do a coding sprint close to midnight&#x2013;say, from 9:30 PM to 11:30
PM&#x2013;I have a harder time falling asleep, even if I'm no longer
thinking about code. If I spend the same time writing, even on my
computer, I'm fine.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Geeking out with W- is a good way to spend evenings. Brush up tech
skills, spend time together, make the house a little smarter.
</p>

<p>
I hadn't realized how similar cat-couch-time is to commuting time. I
should be sure to keep my phone handy. Differences: drawing on my
tablet PC is something that makes decent use of cat-couch-time that I
wouldn't do while commuting, and I can listen to podcasts while
commuting but I'd rather listen to purring when with the cats.
</p>

<p>
Hmm. This gives me a way to practise using my time better during each
phase of my day. I might print this and keep it handy, or bookmark it
and refer to it often.
</p>

<p>

<h4 id="unnumbered-589"><a id="o2b:d2f37460-c7e4-4d5e-9737-3566ee2edda6"></a>Dealing with the doldrums&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="tag"><span class="life">life</span></span></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-589">
<p>
I'm not always a cheerful, energetic ray of sunshine. Sometimes I feel
meh, too. Whether it's due to the disruption of routines or momentum,
frustration with uncertainty, or factors beyond my control, it
happens. During these doldrums, it's harder to work on creative tasks.
It's harder to move, even. There's the temptation to spend the time
browsing the Web or playing games instead&#x2013;tempting activities that
don't require a lot of thinking and have a false sense of progress.
</p>

<p>
Instead of getting stuck in the doldrums&#x2013;or pretending it doesn't
happen&#x2013;I'd rather think about how I can hack my way around it.
Sometimes it's good to just relax into it, relying on the buffer from
good relationships and good finances. After all, I don't often give
myself permission to take a long afternoon nap, or read fiction, or
watch a movie. It can actually be quite satisfying to see things
chugging along even if I don't feel like I'm my usual self. We still
keep the house running smoothly, the financial markets still do well.
(I hope that if any "meh" periods coincide with market corrections,
I'll have the presence of mind to think, "Oh, stocks are on sale!")
</p>

<p>
Sometimes little things I do can dislodge me enough from the Sargasso
sea of suckitude. One of the things I find helpful is to think about
the difference between how this feels and other ways I've felt before.
Sure, I might feel meh at the moment, but there have also been moments
when I've felt awesome, accomplished, productive, energetic, and even
smug (in a good way =) ). Thinking about those different feelings
helps me remember that meh-ness is temporary, and it also helps me
figure out some things I can do that might move me closer to other
feelings. For example, I feel awesome when I learn interesting
technical things that help me save time or make tools. I feel
accomplished when I finish a large batch of cooking or I cross off
plenty of items on my TODO list. I feel energetic when I exercise and
when I solve problems. I feel an extra burst of smugness when I bike,
especially if it's been raining.
</p>

<p>
It can be hard to get over that activation threshold, though. Many
things that give me that positive buzz are creative in nature
(programming, writing, etc.). Fortunately, there are a few activities
that I can do even if my mind's wandering. Walking is a great use of
meh-brain time. I feel somewhat proud of myself because of the
exercise. I went for a 1.5-hour walk the other day, and that felt much
better than sitting at home playing video games. Tidying is another
good use of meh-time, and paperwork is like that too. I can practise
drawing, too - copying figures or slowly untangling my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Writing this, I'm already starting to feel that usual sense of
"Actually, things are pretty awesome." =) I don't expect myself to be
100% on, and it makes no sense to beat myself up for not being on all
the time. But it's nice to know that the occasional "meh"-ness in my
life is temporary, and I can choose to either relax and enjoy it or
play around with some ways to nudge myself out of it.

<p>
If you're like me, you probably have a to-do list several miles long. I like thinking of this as the backlog from agile programming. It's a list of tasks that I could choose to work on, but I haven't committed to doing everything on the list.
</p>

<p>
I tend to add tasks faster than I cross tasks out. (Hmm, I should track this!) This is okay. In fact, this is a good thing. It means that I'll always have a variety of tasks to choose from, which lets me choose good tasks.
</p>

<p>
People manage tasks in different ways. For my personal tasks, I use several large text files in Org Mode for Emacs. Org Mode is an outline-based tool, which makes it easy for me to organize my tasks into projects and projects into themes. It also supports tagging, links, agendas, dynamic views, and all sorts of other great ways to slice-and-dice my task list. Here's how I deal with some of the common challenges people face with a large task backlog:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Making sure important, urgent tasks don't fall through the cracks
</li>
<li>Making sure you don't neglect important but not urgent tasks
</li>
<li>Keeping track of what you're waiting for
</li>
<li>Catching procrastination
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="unnumbered-591"></a>Making sure important, urgent tasks don't fall through the cracks<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-591">
<p>
If something has a deadline, I add the deadline in Org using <code>C-x C-d</code> (<code>org-deadline</code>). This means that reminders will appear on my daily agenda for the 14 days before the deadline, counting down to the deadline itself. (The number of days is controlled by <code>org-deadline-warning-days</code>.) In addition, I usually schedule the task for a day that I want to work on it, so that I can get the task out of the way.
</p>

<p>
I'm careful about what I commit to, erring on the side of under-committing rather than over-committing. I'm selective about my client work and my volunteering. I keep my schedule as open as I can, and I'm not afraid to reschedule if I need to. Hardly anything I work on could be considered urgent. If an urgent request does come in, I ask questions to determine its true urgency, including potential alternatives and consequences of failure.
</p>

<p>
You might not have as much choice about what to work on, but you might also be surprised by how much you can push back. Be careful about what you allow to be urgent in your life.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="unnumbered-592"></a>Making sure you don't neglect important but not urgent tasks<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-592">
<p>
I have plenty of space to work on things that are important but not urgent because I manage my commitments carefully. This means that I can usually finish a few important-but-not-urgent tasks every day.
</p>

<p>
Which tasks do I consider important? I like thinking in terms of projects. Important tasks tend to be associated with projects instead of standing in isolation. Important tasks move me toward a specific goal. I have <a href="http://sachachua.com/evil-plans">many goals and projects</a>, but because they're fewer than the number of tasks I have, I can prioritize them more easily. I can decide that some projects are in the background and some are in focus. Important tasks are the tasks that help me make more progress on the projects I consider important.
</p>

<p>
Because I like having two or three projects on the go, it helps to make sure that I make regular progress on those projects instead of getting carried away on just one. Tracking my time helps me stay aware of that balance. I also review my projects every week and schedule specific tasks for each of them, so I can make a little progress at least. Once I switch context and start thinking about a project, it's easy to pick another couple of tasks in that area and get even more done.

If you're struggling with creating enough space to work on important but not urgent tasks, you might be able to partner up with someone so that you can block off time to work on non-urgent things. Many teams have a rotating schedule for dealing with customer requests or urgent issues. One person covers the requests for a day, allowing the rest of the team to focus. Then the next person takes on that duty, and so on.

<li><a id="unnumbered-593"></a>Keeping track of what you're waiting for<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-593">
<p>
One of the useful tips I picked up from David Allen's Getting Things Done book was the idea of marking a task as WAITING. I usually add a description of what I'm waiting for, who's responsible, and when I want to follow up. This makes it easier to follow up. When I'm waiting for a specific date (ex: the library makes a DVD hold-able after a certain date), I schedule the task for then.
</p>

<p>
I use the <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Boomerang for Gmail</a> extension when I'm waiting for an e-mail reply. Boomerang lets me pop the message back into my inbox if I haven't received a reply by a specific date, so I don't have to keep track of that myself.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="unnumbered-594"></a>Handling less-important but still useful things<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-594">
<p>
There are tasks on my to-do list that have been on that list for years. This is okay.
I'm getting better at noting names and contact information in my tasks so that I can follow up with people even after some time. This is particularly useful for book recommendations. I get a lot of book recommendations and I get most of my books from the library, so there's usually a delay of a few weeks. Because Org Mode lets me add notes and links to the body of a task, I can look up information easily.
</p>

<p>
I work on less-important tasks when I don't feel like working on my major tasks, or when I'm looking for small tasks so I can fill in the gaps of my day. Org Mode gives me plenty of ways to look up tasks. I usually look for tasks by projects, navigating through my outline. I can also look for tasks by effort estimate, so I can see everything that will probably take me less than 15 minutes. Context is useful too - I can search for various tags to find tasks I can do while I'm on the phone, or out on errands, or when I feel like writing or drawing.
</p>

<p>
I like thinking in terms of low-hanging fruit, so I often choose tasks that require little time or effort and have good impact. It can be overwhelming to look at a long list of tasks and decide which ones have good return. It's easier to tag these tasks when you create the task, or to think in terms of projects instead.
</p>

<p>
Some tasks grow in importance or urgency over time. If I want to make sure that I revisit a task on a certain date, I schedule it for then.

<li><a id="unnumbered-595"></a>Catching procrastination<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-595">
<p>
I still end up scheduling tasks multiple times. (I've been putting off redoing my business cards for a few months now!) I've noticed that there are different kinds of procrastination, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Procrastinating because you don't have time today:</b> It's easy to reschedule things a few weeks or a month in advance. In fact, Org has a built-in command for bulk-scattering tasks. From the agenda view, you can type <code>m</code> to mark multiple tasks, then type <code>B</code> and then <code>S</code> to scatter tasks randomly over the next N days. (Call it with a prefix argument as <code>C-u B S</code> to limit it to weekdays.) If I catch myself procrastinating because I don't have enough time, that's usually a sign to be more cautious about my estimates and commitments, so I adjust those too.
</li>
<li><b>Procrastinating because it's less important than other tasks:</b> This is related to the time reason. I have no qualms about pushing less-important tasks forward.
</li>
<li><b>Procrastinating because you don't feel like working on it:</b> Is the task actually important? If it's not, I usually get rid of it without feeling guilty. If it's still useful, I might unschedule it so that I see it only if I'm looking for tasks in that project or in that context. Alternatively, I can just mark the task as CANCELLED or SOMEDAY. If the task is important, I think about whether I'm likely to feel like working on it at some point in the future. If I'm likely to not feel any different about it, I might delegate it, or I might just sit down and do it since procrastination doesn't add value. On the other hand, if I'm likely to feel like working on it at some point, then I tag it with that context and push it out to some other date.
</li>
<li><b>Procrastinating because you forgot about it:</b> I usually check my agenda every day and Org shows forgotten things in a different colour, so I catch these quickly. If the tasks are more important than the tasks I've already scheduled, I might work on those first. Alternatively, I might schedule it for sometime later.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I procrastinate based on my to-do list, not based on my inbox. The inbox is a terribly unstructured way to manage your tasks. I use Boomerang for Gmail to defer some mail to a later date, but that's usually so that I can pop it back into my inbox the day that I meet someone so that I have context and so that I don't have to copy the link into the calendar entry or my TO-DO list.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="unnumbered-596"></a>Wrapping up<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-unnumbered-596">
<p>
So that's how I deal with having a large backlog. I focus first on the stuff that I need to do, and I make sure that shows up on my agenda. Then I make it easy to look for stuff that I want to do using Org's support for projects, tags, time estimates, and so on. I don't feel guilty about having lots of tasks to choose from. I view my backlog positively. It lets me do good stuff without worrying too much about how I spend my time.
</p>

<p>
How do you deal with your backlog? =)

<p>
It's been twelve years since David Allen published Getting Things Done, with its geek-friendly flowcharts and processes for handling tasks in an interrupt-driven life. The way I manage my tasks is heavily influenced by GTD. I think in terms of next actions, waiting, and someday, and I have weekly reviews. I modified the TODO states a little to reflect what I need. It's time to think about those states again to see what I can tweak and what reports I could use.
</p>

<p>
I use Org Mode in Emacs to manage my tasks and my notes. I can customize it to give me different kinds of reports, such as showing me all of my unscheduled tasks, or all tasks with a specific category, or even projects that are "stuck" (no next actions defined). Thinking about my processes will help me figure out what reports I want and how I want to use them.
</p>

<p>
Here are different types of tasks and how I track them:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Things I can work on right now (next actions): <code>TODO</code>
</li>
<li>Things that I can work on after a different task is finished: currently <code>WAITING</code>, but probably better to implement with org-depend
</li>
<li>Things I will revisit at a certain date, but I don't need to think about them until then: <code>TODO</code>, scheduled (I used to use <code>POSTPONED</code>)
</li>
<li>Things that would be nice to do someday, but maybe are incompletely specified or understood: <code>SOMEDAY</code>
</li>
<li>Things I have decided not to work on: <code>CANCELLED</code>
</li>
<li>Things I have asked someone else to do: <code>DELEGATED</code>
</li>
<li>Things I can ask someone else to do: <code>TODELEGATE</code>
</li>
<li>Things I am waiting for (usually not based on date) and that I need to follow up on: <code>WAITING</code>
</li>
<li>Things I can write about: <code>TOBLOG</code>. These are pretty optional, so I don't want them in my TODO list&#x2026;
</li>
<li>If something is a duplicate of something else - remove TODO keyword and add link?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I use the following code for an agenda view of unscheduled tasks:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">sacha/org-agenda-skip-scheduled</span> ()
  (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline 'regexp <span class="org-string">"\n]+&gt;"</span>))

(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
   '(<span class="org-string">"u"</span> <span class="org-string">"Unscheduled tasks"</span> alltodo <span class="org-string">""</span>
     ((org-agenda-skip-function 'sacha/org-agenda-skip-scheduled)
     (org-agenda-overriding-header <span class="org-string">"Unscheduled TODO entries: "</span>))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So the to-do process looks like this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every week, review my <a href="http://sachachua.com/evil-plans">evil plans</a> and projects. Check my agenda without the routine tasks to see what new things I'm working on. Schedule a few tasks to encourage me to make regular progress.
</li>
<li>Every day, go through my Org agenda (<code>C-c a a</code>) and do all the tasks that are scheduled.
</li>
<li>When I'm done or if I feel like working on something else:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do I feel like doing? If there's a specific activity that I feel like:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to the relevant project/section of my TODO list, or check the TODOs by context (drawing, writing, etc.)
</li>
<li>Clock in on that task.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's a specific task I feel like working on:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Find the task, maybe with <code>C-u C-c C-w</code> (<code>org-refile</code>) and work on it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's a new idea I want to work on:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <code>org-capture</code> to create the task, file it in the appropriate project, and then clock in.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I have an idea for a task, use <code>org-capture</code> to create the task and file it in the appropriate project.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
How do I want to improve this?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Maybe get more used to working with contexts?</b> I have all these Org Agenda commands and I hardly ever use them. I tend to work with projects instead. Actually, working with projects makes sense too, because that minimizes the real context shift.
</li>
<li><b>Get better at reviewing existing tasks.</b> I started tracking the number of tasks in each state (DONE, TODO, etc.), which nudged me to review the tasks and cross old tasks off. If I streamline my process for capturing tasks, filing them, and reviewing them by project/context/effort, then I can get better at choosing good tasks to work on from my existing TODO list.
</li>
<li><b>Estimate effort for more tasks, and use that more often</b> I have some reports that can filter or sort by estimated effort. I don't use effort that much, though. Does it makes sense to get into the habit of choosing tasks by estimated time as an alternative approach? I usually have fairly large, flexible blocks of time&#x2026;
</li>
<li><b>Tag things by level of energy required?</b> <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/11/high-energy-and-low-energy-activities/">I want to take advantage of high-energy times.</a> So, when I feel alert and creative, I want to focus on coding and writing. I can save things like paperwork for low-energy times. I can tag some tasks as :lowenergy: and then filter my reports.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
"You're pretty organized, right? Do you have a system for productivity that I could use?" someone said to me. She sounded frustrated by her lack of progress on some long-standing projects. I shrugged, unsure how to help.
</p>

<p>
I don't consider myself super-productive. I am, however, less stressed than many people seem to be. I've been learning to keep realistic expectations, get rid of less-important tasks, and work in quick, small, useful chunks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Realistic expectations:</b> We tend to overestimate how much we can do, particularly if we're looking a week or two ahead. Even if last week was derailed by interruptions, we hope next week will be a smooth ride. I'm guilty of this myself. I compensate by expecting little of myself - just one to three important tasks each day, moving forward a little bit at a time. If I find myself with spare time and motivation, I check my other tasks for something to work on. It's okay if I end up procrastinating something. That usually means I spent the time on something I valued more.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ruthless elimination:</b> "But how do I motivate myself?" This is another thing that people often struggle with. I use different strategies depending on what I need. For example, I'm currently working on a project with a high risk of failure and a fair bit of work. For me, it helps to amplify the perceived benefits, downplay the small pieces of work that I need to do (it's just a small task), and downplay the risks (failure isn't all that bad). On some other projects, I might decide that my lack of motivation is a clue that I should just wrap up the project, get rid of specific tasks, delegate work, or transform those tasks into things I might enjoy more.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rapid exploration:</b> After I adjust for realistic expectations and get rid of tasks through ruthless elimination, I think of tiny tasks that will help me move towards my goals. That way, I can explore and get feedback faster. Then I try to get as much value as I can from those steps, usually ending up with blog post ideas and lessons learned in addition to the thing itself. This also means that I can squeeze work into 15- to 2-hour chunks instead of waiting for a 4-hour span of uninterrupted, energetic time.
</p>

<p>
There are a bunch of other things that help me out (keeping outlines of projects and tasks in Org Mode, documenting as much as I can, knowing my tools well), but those three behaviours above seem to be different from the way many people around me work. Hope that helps!

More than anything, I wanted time. Ever since I was a kid, I had
always been acutely aware of how short a time we actually have. (Can I
blame this on reading about Raistlin's hourglass eyes in Dragonlance,
which I suppose was my first introduction to Stoic negative
visualization?) Being halfway around the world from family is hard
enough. I see the time pass for my parents in their Facebook pictures

about making sure I’m not breaking many promises. Sometimes I slip up,
and then I know I have to slow down and take my time. I’m curious
about some things that might improve my effectiveness (dictation or

But my own favorite part of the book was in the description of the “Renaissance Man ideal”. This is the idea that you will have the most enjoyable life, AND the best chance at very early financial independence, by developing a whole load of interesting skills. The amazing part is that these skills don’t just sit independently in your mind like a bunch of unused kitchen appliances in a pantry. They start to reach out and connect to each other in unexpected ways, and start solving all of your problems for you. They build your curiosity and start sucking in still more skills that you can’t help acquiring. And before you know it, you are able to live a superb life on only a tiny fraction of the spending that a normal person does, even while you might end up accidentally earning money even more easily than before you embraced the Renaissance Ideal.

It’s been more than ten years since David Allen published Getting
Things Done. I still haven’t come up with a fully trustable system,
but Emacs + Org + Evernote is getting there. I’m glad I’m back to
using Org. I’m starting to run into the reminders I set for important
business paperwork last year, and I might have missed that if I was
relying on my memory or my calendar.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, when I catch myself feeling frazzled, I stop and
write down all of my open loops: the things that tug on my attention.
Some of them must be ruthlessly demoted to “someday/maybe,” or even
let go. And then I can methodically go through the others, crossing
them off as I finish them. Getting it all down on paper helps me make
sense of things and stops me from feeling overwhelmed.

I'm reading Ben Arment's <i>Dream Year: Make the Leap From a Job You
Hate to a Life You Love</i> (2014), and there's a reminder in here about
the choice between the fear of failure and the fear of insignificance.
"Choose the fear of insignificance," the author says. And I think:
Hmm, actually, I'm okay with insignificance (or minor minor minor
significance, in any case). Stoicism reminds us that after thousands
of years, very little of this will matter. But maybe I should care a
little bit. Since I've done all this work to minimize the fear of
failure anyway. I might as well play on that side of the equation.

I've been thinking about this recently because I'm wondering whether I
should take this experience in social business and make something
bigger out of it. I could probably negotiate something with my main
consulting clients so that we could get ideas or even code out in the
wider world, or I could independently develop something that they and
other people would be welcome to use. I haven't quite sorted out what
that would be like yet, but I imagine it would start off as open
source components, then possibly consulting and product development
once I've established a reputation in that community.
</p>

<p>
Of social business, Emacs, and blogging, though, I like Emacs the
most. There's something about it. I like the community a lot:
interesting people doing interesting things, and a remarkably flexible
platform that has kept me curious and fascinated for years. If I were
to show up in a bigger way, I suppose that would involve writing more
guides, and maybe understanding enough of the core of complex things
like Org and Emacs itself so that I could contribute to the codebase.
I tend to focus on workflow more than bugfixes or new features,
though&#x2026; I think there's something interesting in how people use the
same things in such different ways. Maybe I'll write more about my
evolving workflow, using that and personal projects as excuses to keep tweaking.
</p>

<p>
As for blogging, there are bucketloads of people who are happy to give
other people advice on what to do and how to do it. I'm interested in
keeping it unintimidating and useful for personal learning, but I'm
more excited about and curious about those other two causes. Still, I
can show by example, and I can offer advice and encouragement when
people ask.
</p>

<p>
What are the differences between this slightly bigger life and my
current one? I think part of it is related to the way that I've been
minimizing my commitments during this 5-year experiment, being very
careful about what I say yes to and what I promise my time towards.
Part of it is taking the initiative instead of waiting for requests or
sparks of inspiration. Part of it is working more deliberately towards
a goal. It's not going to be a big big life, but it might be
interesting to experiment with.

I like getting a head start on new year plans. No, that's not true. I
like re-planning when things are a little bit clearer and when things
change. It's nice to take a look at where I am, where I might get to,
and maybe what I can do with more reinvestment.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-unnumbered-621">
<p>
I hardly ever finish projects. I start them with a burst of
enthusiasm, and then I trail off when something else catches my
attention. I've learned to work with this instead of beating myself up
about it. On some days, I might even consider it a good thing. Here's
one of the things I've learned:
</p>

<p>
<b>You can trick your brain by moving the goalposts.</b>
</p>

<p>
Let's say that you're working on a project. Toward the end of the
project, you catch yourself losing steam. You've gotten 80% of the way
there, and the remaining 20% of the work will take four times as much
time. The itch to start a different project is pulling you away.
</p>

<p>
Don't think of yourself as nearly done. Think of yourself as getting
started on another new project that just happens to overlap with the
previous one.
</p>

<p>
In fact, mentally set the beginning of that project to include some of
the work you've just completed, to take advantage of the <a href="http://io9.com/how-to-force-people-to-do-anything-and-have-them-thank-1648774440">Endowed
Progress effect</a> (<a href="https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/jnunes/intellcont/Endowed%20Progress%20Effect-1.pdf">research PDF</a>).
</p>

<p>
Tada! Goalposts moved. You might find that the newly-reframed project
is now novel enough to be included in the list of new projects you
enjoy working on, and it might even tempt you away from other
distractions.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts">Moving the goalposts</a> is usually a bad thing. It's why many people
never feel rich, because whenever they reach what used to be
unimaginable wealth, they find that the amount of money needed for
them to feel happy has gone up. (Solution: don't anchor happiness to
amounts of money.) Moving the goalposts has led to many a logical
fallacy in heated arguments. But if you don't like playing a
close-quarters game, moving the goalposts further away can help.
</p>

<p>
I often use this technique for life-long learning, especially for
things that you can't really declare finished. Can one ever finish
learning how to write or draw or program? No, but you can keep moving
your targets a little forward as you learn.
</p>

<p>
You might think, "I won't be able to celebrate achieving my original
goal!" <b>You can still celebrate milestones.</b> Better yet, celebrate
even the tiny, tiny steps that you take towards your
(constantly-moving) goal. Look behind you once in a while and
celebrate the progress you've made.
</p>

<p>
It can be hard to see progress if you don't have anything tangible.
<b>Invest time in looking for useful chunks</b> that you can extract even
from work in progress. It's surprising how few projects are truly all
or nothing. If you can share drafts, prototypes, alpha or beta
versions, or even blog posts about the journey, you don't have to
worry about the whole thing being a complete waste of time if you get
distracted from the project before you finish it. If you always wait
until you've finished something, you might end up leaving <a href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/">a mess of
incomplete projects around</a>.
</p>

<p>
Worried that your mind will see through this technique and lose
interest even earlier in the process? Try being playful about it
instead of being too serious. Yes, it's a mental trick (and not even a
particularly complex one), but if your mind likes novelty and
beginnings, it can hardly fault you for giving it what it likes.
</p>

<p>
This technique doesn't solve everything - I haven't been able to write
a 200-page Emacs book yet, and our couch still doesn't have a
slipcover. But it helps me from time to time, and maybe it will help
you too!

It's not easy <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16266462305">being on Windows</a> instead of one of the more scriptable
operating systems out there, but I stay on it because I like the
drawing programs. Cygwin and Vagrant fill enough gaps to keep me
mostly sane. (Although maybe I should work up the courage to <a href="http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html">dual-boot Windows 8.1 and a Linux distribution</a>, and then get my <a href="http://virantha.com/2014/03/17/one-touch-scanning-with-fujitsu-scansnap-in-linux/">ScanSnap working</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm making do. Thanks to <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> and the abundance of libraries
available through NPM, Javascript is shaping up to be a surprisingly
useful scripting language.
</p>

<p>
After I used the Flickr API library for Javascript to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/de-dupe-link-using-flickr-api-neaten-archive-link-sketches-blog-posts/">cross-reference
my Flickr archive with my blog posts</a>, I looked around for other things
I could do with it. <a href="http://webecoz.com/">photoSync</a> occasionally didn't upload new pictures
I added to its folders (or at least, not as quickly as I wanted). I
wanted to replace photoSync with my own script that would:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>upload the picture only if it doesn't already exist,
</li>
<li>add tags based on the filename,
</li>
<li>add the photo to my Sketchbook photoset,
</li>
<li>move the photo to the "To blog" folder, and
</li>
<li>make it easy for me to refer to the Flickr image in my blog post or index.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/chbrown/flickr-with-uploads">flickr-with-uploads</a> library made it easy to upload images and
retrieve information, although the format was slightly different from
the Flickr API library I used previously. (In retrospect, I should've
checked the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/flickrapi">Flickr API</a> documentation first - there's an example upload
request right on the main page. Oh well! Maybe I'll change it if I
feel like rewriting it.)
</p>

<p>
I searched my existing photos to see if a photo with that title
already existed. If it did, I displayed an Org-style list item with a
link. If it didn't exist, I uploaded it, set the tags, added the item
to the photo set, and moved it to the folder. Then I displayed an
Org-style link, but using a plus character instead of a minus
character. (Both + and - can be used for lists in Org.)
</p>

<p>
While using <code>console.log(...)</code> to display these links in the terminal
allowed me to mark and copy the link, I wanted to go one step further.
Could I send the links directly to Emacs? I looked into getting
<code>org-protocol</code> to work, but I was having problems figuring this out.
(I solved those problems; details later in this post.)
</p>

<p>
What were some other ways I could get the information into Emacs aside from copying and pasting from the terminal window? Maybe I could put text directly into the clipboard. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipboard">node-clipboard</a> package didn't build for me and I couldn't get <a href="https://github.com/xavi-/node-copy-paste">node-copy-paste</a> to work either,about the node-copy-paste README told me about the existence of the <code>clip</code> command-line utility, which worked for me.
</p>

<p>
On Windows, <code>clip</code> allows you to pipe the output of commands into your
clipboard. (There are similar programs for Linux or Mac OS X.) In
Node, you can start a child process and communicate with it through
pipes.
</p>

<p>
I got a little lost trying to figure out how to turn a string into a
streamable object that I could set as the new standard input for the
<code>clip</code> process I was going to spawn, but the solution turned out to be
much simpler than that. Just <code>write(...)</code> to the appropriate stream,
and call <code>end()</code> when you're done.
</p>

<p>
Here's the relevant bit of code that takes my <code>result</code> array and puts it into my clipboard:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
var child = cp.spawn('clip');
child.stdin.write(result.join("\n"));
child.stdin.end();
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, to get to that point, I had to revise my script. Instead of
letting all the callbacks finish whenever they wanted, I needed to be
able to run some code after everything was done. I was a little
familiar with the <code>async</code> library, so I used that.

<p>
Wheeee! Hooray for automation. I made a Windows batch script like so:
</p>

<p>
up.bat
</p>
<pre class="example">
node g:\code\node\flickr-upload.js %*
</pre>

<p>
and away I went. Not only did I have a handy way to process images from the command line, I could also mark the files in Emacs Dired with <code>m</code>, then type <code>!</code> to execute my <code>up</code> command on the selected images. Mwahaha!
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I thought I'd write it up in case other people were curious
about using Node to code little utilities, filling the clipboard in
Windows, or getting data back into Emacs (sometimes the clipboard is
enough).
</p>

<p>
Back to <code>org-protocol</code>, since I was curious about it. With <code>(require 'org-protocol) (server-start)</code>, <code>emacsclient
org-protocol://store-link:/foo/bar</code> worked when I entered it at the
command prompt. I was having a hard time getting it to work under
Node, but eventually I figured out that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I needed to pass <code>-n</code> as one of the arguments to <code>emacsclient</code> so
that it would return right away.
</li>
<li>The <code>:</code> after <code>store-link</code> is important! I was passing
<code>org-protocol://store-link/foo/bar</code> and wondering why it opened up a
file called <code>bar</code>. <code>org-protocol://store-link:/foo/bar</code> was what I
needed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I only just figured out that last bit while writing this post.
Here's a small demonstration program:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-js2">var cp = require('child_process');
var child = cp.execFile('emacsclient', ['-n', 'org-protocol://store-link:/foo/bar']);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Yay!

For practice, I converted the QUnit tests to Jasmine. The first part of the test was easy, but I wanted a clean way to do the HTML fixture-based tests for prettydate.update too.
<a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery">Jasmine-JQuery</a> gives you a handy way to have HTML fixtures. Here's what my code ended up as:
</p>

<p>
<code>spec/DateSpec.js</code>
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-js2">describe("PrettyDate.format", function() {
    function checkDate(name, then, expected) {
        it(name, function() {
            expect(prettyDate.format('2008/01/28 22:25:00Z', then)).toEqual(expected);
        });
    }
    checkDate("should display recent times", '2008/01/28 22:24:30Z', 'just now');
    checkDate("should display times within a minute", '2008/01/28 22:23:30Z', '1 minute ago');
    checkDate("should display times within an hour", '2008/01/28 21:23:30Z', '1 hour ago');
    checkDate("should display times within a day", '2008/01/27 22:23:30Z', 'Yesterday');
    checkDate("should display times within two days", '2008/01/26 22:23:30Z', '2 days ago');
});
describe("PrettyDate.update", function() {
    function domtest(name, now, first, second) {
       it(name, function() {
           loadFixtures('test_fixture.html');
           var links = document.getElementById('qunit-fixture').getElementsByTagName('a');
           expect(links[0].innerHTML).toEqual('January 28th, 2008');
           expect(links[2].innerHTML).toEqual('January 27th, 2008');
           prettyDate.update(now);

Richard wanted to know which Google Chrome extensions I use. Here's the list:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom">AdBlock</a>: I still see ads, but I probably see fewer ads than before.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk">AngularJS Batarang</a>: Great for debugging AngularJS applications.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.any.do/">Any.do Extension</a>: I use this on my phone. Still thinking about how I can get something working with Org Mode and my phone. Might replace this with MobileOrg.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lmjegmlicamnimmfhcmpkclmigmmcbeh">Application Launcher for Drive (by Google)</a>: I hardly use this, but it seems like a good idea.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/annmcneienljahlbfoaomcfghmomhfho">Boomerang Calendar</a>: Recognizes dates in e-mails and makes it easy to create appointments. Might not need it after Google improves its interface some more.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mdanidgdpmkimeiiojknlnekblgmpdll">Boomerang for Gmail</a>: Great for delaying replies, following up in case of non-response, or getting things to turn up in your inbox after a specified delay.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg">Capture Webpage Screenshot - FireShot</a>: Can come in handy for full-page screenshots.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dnfpcpfijpdhabaoieccoclghgplmpbd">CSS Reloader</a>: Handy during development.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdbofhhdmcladcmmfjolgndfkpobecpg">Don't track me Google</a>: I use this mainly to remove the annoying Google redirection that happens when you copy links from search results without clicking through them. This way, I can copy and paste cleaner URLs.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ddaloccgjfibfpkalenodgehlhkgoahe">Dragon Web Extension</a>: Theoretically allows me to use speech recognition to control Chrome. I still haven't gotten Dragon Naturally Speaking to be part of my workflow.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pioclpoplcdbaefihamjohnefbikjilc">Evernote Web Clipper</a>: Evernote is a great way to stash things I may want to refer to later.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hipbfijinpcgfogaopmgehiegacbhmob">Feedly</a>: The extension lets me quickly subscribe to blogs. I prefer reading them on my phone, though.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aohghmighlieiainnegkcijnfilokake">Google Docs</a>: Handy for sharing documents and editing them online.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd">Hangouts</a>: I use this for video chats.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd">LastPass: Free Password Manager</a>: Handy for storing and sharing passwords.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bdakmnplckeopfghnlpocafcepegjeap">RescueTime for Chrome &amp; ChromeOS</a>: Tracks the sites I visit. I'm not doing anything with this data yet.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp">Rikaikun</a>: Helps me learn Japanese when I hover over kanji.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd">RSS Subscription Extension (by Google)</a>: Displays a feed icon in the address bar if the site has alternate links to feeds. This way, I don't have to hunt around for the right link.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pgphcomnlaojlmmcjmiddhdapjpbgeoc">Send from Gmail (by Google)</a>: Makes Gmail the default handler for e-mail addresses.
</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Tampermonkey</a>: For injecting the Javascript that Skewer needs so that I can interact with webpages from Emacs. Could probably get away with using a bookmarklet instead. This tends to slow down Chrome, so I enable it only when I'm planning to develop.
</li>

I <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/01/first-thoughts-on-windows-8/">upgraded to Microsoft Windows 8</a> in January 2013 mainly primarily
because I noticed myself resisting the change. For the most part, I
adapted easily. I liked using Win-q to launch applications, and I even
got the hang of the complicated procedure for shutting down.
</p>

<p>
Still, the upgrade was a step backwards in terms of drawing on my
tablet PC. On Windows 7, I had disabled the touchscreen in order to
make stylus use easier; on Windows 8 (and later 8.1), I couldn't
reliably disable the touchscreen. The option had disappeared from the
built-in Pen &amp; Touch configuration dialog, and disabling it through
the hardware devices list sometimes didn't work.
</p>

<p>
This meant that I either had to wear something to insulate my palm
from the screen in order to avoid accidental touches (even my thinnest
glove was still warm and unwieldy), or I had to occasionally erase
stray dots. Both got in the way of drawing on my computer, so I didn't
do much of either.
</p>

<p>
While upgrading various pieces of software (Autodesk Sketchbook Pro,
Dragon Naturally Speaking), I thought to check if Lenovo or Wacom had
released new drivers yet. Wacom had! Woohoo. I insntalled the <a href="http://us.wacom.com/en/feeldriver/">Wacom
Feel driver</a>, rebooted my computer, and found the Wacom Pen &amp; Touch
dialog had a checkbox for disabling touch.
</p>

<p>
It's funny how these little inconveniences can add just enough
friction to make something feel annoying, and how smoothening those
inconveniences over can make a big difference in how you work and how
you feel about it. I'm looking forward to playing around with the new
features in Sketchbook Pro now. Glad I checked for updates!

I have an Asus Transformer Pad Infinity (TF700T), which I got shortly
after its release because I was curious about exploring tablets as a
sketchnoting option but I was adamantly opposed to getting an Apple
product. I should probably have waited for the reviews to come in,
since the TF700T turned out to be a lemon (apparently the processor
wasn't quite up to the task of driving the display) and by the time I
sat down and focused on getting past all the excuses and all the
potential configuration options for speeding things up, the return
window had passed. I suppose I could try to sell it, but it doesn't
seem right to inflict the same problem on someone else.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I've reflashed it to CROMBi, which the Internet says is
supposed to be much better. While I'm waiting for everything to be set
up again, I want to think about how a tablet could fit into my life
and make things better. That way, I can decide if it's worth spending
the time fixing this up, spending the money to upgrade to a newer
tablet, or leaving well enough alone.
</p>

<p>
What do other people use their tablets for, and what other uses might I want to explore?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Business
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reading could be handy, especially as a second screen for technical references.
</li>
<li>Lightweight device for writing in cafes? My laptop isn't that heavy, but I could give it a try.
</li>
<li>Browsing? Maybe, if I can get performance up.
</li>
<li>E-mail? My phone is more convenient.
</li>
<li>Reviewing my sketches? Maybe, if I can fix the lag issue.
</li>
<li>Drawing on this tablet? Frustrating because of the lag.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Personal
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cooking? It might be handy to have large copies of recipes and maybe even a digital shopping list.
</li>
<li>Browsing? The attentional separation of doing casual browsing on a separate device might be good for training my mind.
</li>
<li>Learning? Flashcards, perhaps?
</li>
<li>Watching stuff? I rarely watch movies, and when I do, I watch them on the TV so I can hang out on the sofa with W-.
</li>
<li>Gaming is popular, but I don't often play games (and when I do, I have the Vita or the PS3).
</li>
<li>Some kind of home console, with weather, calendar, and a shopping list? Maybe, but it seems like overkill.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Meh. I'm possibly even at the point where I wouldn't consider buying
it from my own business. It's a pity, but sometimes I make bad
decisions. Just stick it in a drawer (or donate it) and let it
depreciate over time, writing it off as a learning experience? Hmm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I'm going to try to revive it as a business tablet first, seeing if I
can get to the point where I'd feel comfortable leaving my laptop
behind. If that doesn't work out, I'll experiment with personal
applications before buying it from my business. If that still doesn't
work, I think I'll wait a little for future crops of tablets - I'd
want something that responds quickly and has a proper stylus.
</p>

<p>
Ah, tech!

One of the neat things about learning web development is that the Web
is full of examples you can learn from. You can use your browser's
View Page Source or View Source command (available from the
right-click menu in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet
Explorer). An even better way to explore, though, is to use the
<b>Inspect Element</b> action from the right-click menu in those browsers.
If you right-click on the item you want to learn more about, you'll be
able to see the HTML and the current CSS applied to the page.
</p>

<p>
I use Google Chrome most of the time, so I'll show you Inspect Element
screen from that browser.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="file:~/screenshots/2014-11-10 15_37_06-CSS-Tricks.png" alt="2014-11-10 15_37_06-CSS-Tricks.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
You'll see the HTML on the left side and the CSS on the right. You can
check or uncheck different CSS rules, and you can double-click on
things to edit them. Check out the right-click menus for even more
options.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you may need to click on a different element in order to see
the CSS rules that are relevant to what you're curious about. As you
hover over different elements, you'll see them highlighted on the
page.
</p>

<p>
If you click on the <b>Console</b> tab, you can experiment with Javascript
too. If you want to view both the inspect element information and the
Javascript console at the same time, click on the icon that looks like
a <code>&gt;</code> on the right side. This is particularly handy if you have a
large screen.
</p>

<p>
Hope that helps!

I've been distracted for the past two months, since I've been focusing on consulting more than on my personal projects. Now that things are stable again, I'd like to see if I can make better use of delegation as a way to expand my capabilities, learn more, and spread the opportunities. There are so many people with talents and skills out there, and there <i>must</i> be a way that I can get the hang of this.
</p>

<p>
What's getting in my way?
</p>

<p>
Mostly it's that I haven't sat down and thought about:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The projects I'm willing to invest money into, in addition to time - although maybe I should just treat my time as fungible and delegation as a skill that's worth learning anyway, so I should open up all my personal projects for consideration
</li>
<li>Specific processes that I want to delegate, although I do have a decent-sized <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/sachachua.com/#folders/0B8LpkeSVIjRYVHZCQzVCYTJ5X3M">process library</a> that I even share publicly
</li>
<li>How I can reduce my involvement in things that are tied to me personally, and focus more on things where I can bring in other people
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also have some guilt about the distinction between tasks I can definitely defend as being business-related, and tasks that are much more personal. For example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reviewing my accounting records and draft tax return - Definitely business.
</li>
<li>Transcribing Emacs Chat sessions and recorded presentations - Well&#x2026; Technically, people sometimes pay me for Emacs-related things and I'm working on packaging some things up as pay-what-you-can guides, so that's okay, I guess?
</li>
<li>Filling in recipes from Hacklab cooking nights - Definitely personal
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The main benefit of claiming things as a business expense is saving roughly 15% in tax, but if that's mentally getting in the way of my just taking advantage of this, I should totally switch the contracts over to my personal credit card and just go for it until I've gotten the hang of this again. I'm nowhere close to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/becoming-own-client/">my target of fully replacing</a> the hours I've spent earning during this experiment (2829.6 hours worked, 486.8 hours delegated through oDesk, plus more through Paypal). But on the flipside, I don't want to assign makework that I really should just automate or eliminate. Although maybe I <i>should</i> challenge myself to find something useful, since that gives people an opportunity to work and to improve their skills.
</p>

<p>
Anyway.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Stuff I don't particularly enjoy doing, but that could help:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setting up events, coordinating with people, etc.
</li>
<li>Comparison-shopping
</li>
<li>Data entry
</li>
<li>Organizing
</li>
</ul>

<p>
What would "getting the hang of this" look like? Future Sacha would:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Have these beautifully documented step-by-step processes for consistently getting stuff done, with enough volume and throughput that things happen consistently
</li>
<li>Work with people who are also improving their skills and doing well
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmm. One of the things I'm looking forward to learning at work is the ability to sketch out a design or give some tips on how to do a report (which tables, what existing report to build on, etc.) and have someone else learn by doing it.
</p>

<p>
Maybe what I need is something like that for my personal projects,
too. If I get better at sketching out what I want, then I or someone
else can make it happen. For example, with Emacs Chats and Emacs
Hangouts, I'd like to eventually get to the point of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Having a list of questions or topics I'm working my through
</li>
<li>Having a page where people can see the things I'm curious about and volunteer to chat with me about them
</li>
<li>Coordinating with those people about when we're both available
</li>
<li>Sharing a calendar and events where people can see upcoming entries
</li>
<li>Getting everything recorded, processed, summarized, transcribed, and blogged about
</li>
<li>Harvesting interesting snippets for a guide
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And for Quantified Self Toronto:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Picture of sign-up whiteboard + copy of videos = processed videos uploaded and blogged about
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For Hacklab and cooking:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Picture of food + links to recipe = blog post draft with recipe ingredients, photo, links to recipes = updated wiki page
</li>
</ul>

<p>
And a few experiments with Fiverr and other micro-outsourcing sites,
too, just because.
</p>

<p>
You know, even if I don't end up feeling comfortable with calling
those business expenses, I'm fine with it being a personal donation,
since the communities are awesome. And it's stuff I would probably end
up doing anyway because it's the Right Thing to Do.

Imagine I have amazing assistants and a smoothly-running team. What am I doing with those capabilities?
</p>

<p>
2 days a week, I'm focused on talking to people. I'm booked efficiently; tea, lunch, tea, second tea. Some of these meetings involve walks instead of food. The meetings cluster in various locations in order to minimize travel time. I might have one day for face-to-face meetings and one day for virtual meetings.
</p>

<p>
After each meeting, I have at least half an hour to define next actions and get the ball rolling. It's easy to prioritize based on time and importance. We get the first actions out right away, impressing people, and then we follow up with depth. My assistant fills in the time with other tasks from the next actions list. I have at least 20 hours of work for people, so it's easy for them to focus.
</p>

<p>
Types of things I delegate:
Scheduling - I forward them emails and get back neatly formatted calendar entries
Email response handling - they read my mail, prioritize, send me action items, and work on tasks.
Web research - I send them questions and get back summaries of the top ten resources I should read. I suggest search queries, and they add their own.
Illustration - I have backup illustrators who can sketchnote things that I can't get to, or who can share different styles and metaphors.
Development - When I have an idea about Rails or Wordpress, I can work with someone to make it happen.
Web design - themes, tweaks, beautifully HTMLized pages&#x2026;
Copywriting and copyediting - I send things over and get polished, engaging content
Calls - Assistants can take care of calling businesses when they're open and following up if needed, such as when setting appointments or making reservations.
Layout - I share a Dropbox folder with a bunch of graphics or documents. The assistant lays things out so that they're well-balanced in terms of whitespace and size.
Transcription - I save webinars and interviews (or set people up to record) into a Dropbox shared folder, and I send an email. I get a well-formatted blog post or document with the cleaned-up transcript.
Outlining and writing - someone helps me brainstorm blog post topics and outlines, fleshing them out with research, and organizing the topics into books
Video - editing, synchronizing sound, adding transitions, etc.
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I also have recurring tasks for projects and initiatives I care about. Things just work smoothly. I get confirmations.
</p>

<p>
I have this lovely web-based process manual and a visual overview of tasks.
</p>

<p>
I'm always collecting people for my pipeline.
Hiring is not stressful - I have good onboarding and offboarding
processes. I hire shortly before I really need to, so that I can ramp
up people.

<p>
Do you produce "evergreen" content that people regularly want to refer to? You'll get lasting value from sketchnotes about topics that are perennially interesting or useful, while time-sensitive or news updates have limited benefits.
</p>

<p>
Do you have a large, social-media savvy audience in terms of blog readers, website visitors, or social media followers? Sketchnotes can help you convert them to podcast listeners or get them to check out a specific podcast. It can also get more value out of other resources such as blog posts and e-books. Newsletter subscribers and podcast subscribers don't get as much immediate value from sketchnotes because they don't see them right away. If you're active on Twitter or Facebook, you'll be able to get more value out of the sketchnotes because of embedded images in the news stream as well as RTs and CCs.
</p>

<p>
Is your podcast a source of revenue? What kind of business benefit do you anticipate? What kinds of increases in readership or other benefits would you consider worth different levels of investment (knowing there's no such thing as a guarantee&#x2026; =) )? Sketching an episode that already has an edited transcript can be more cost-effective, because transcripts allow the sketchnote artist can get an quick overview of the podcast's structure and confirm the spelling of important words.

It's been a little over two years since I started consulting for this
one client of mine. Come to think of it, it's the longest I've ever
spent working on the same project. I like the team and what we work
on, so I continue to do this even though I'm slowly nudging the
balance of my time closer to retirement/leisure. I want them to be able to do cool stuff even when I've moved all the way over

One of the things a good manager does is to recognize and reward
people's achievements, especially if people exceeded expectations. A
large corporation might have some standard ways to reward good work: a
team lunch, movie tickets, gift certificates, days off, reward points,
events, and so on. Startups and small businesses might be able to come
up with even more creative ways of celebrating success.
</p>

<p>
In tech, I think good managers take extra care to recognize when
people have gone beyond the normal call of duty. It makes sense. Many
people earn salaries without overtime pay, might not get a bonus even
if they've sacrificed time with family or other discretionary
activities, and might not be able to take vacation time easily.
</p>

<p>
It got me thinking: <b>Now that I'm on my own, how do I want to
celebrate achievements</b>&#x2013;especially when they are a result of tilting
the balance towards work?
</p>

<p>
When I'm freelancing, extra time is paid for, so some reward is there
already. I like carving out part of those earnings for my opportunity
fund, rewarding my decision-making by giving myself more room to
explore.
</p>

<p>
During a sprint, the extra focus time sometimes comes from reducing my
housework. When things relax, then, I like celebrating by cooking good
meals, investing in our workflows at home, and picking up the slack.
</p>

<p>
I also like taking notes so that I can build on those successes. I
might not be able to include a lot of details, but having a few
memory-hooks is better than not having any.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people are really happy with the team's performance, so
there's extra good karma. Of the different non-monetary ways that
people can show their appreciation within a corporate framework, which
ones would I lean towards?
</p>

<p>
I definitely appreciate slowing down the pace after big deliverables.
Sustained concentration is difficult, so it helps to be able to push
back if there are too many things on the go.
</p>

<p>
At work, I like taking time to document lessons learned in more
detail. I'd get even more of a kick out of it if other people picked
up those notes and did something even cooler with the ideas. That
ranks high on my warm-and-fuzzy feeling scale. It can take time for
people to have the opportunity to do something similar, but that's
okay. Sometimes I hear from people years later, and that's even
awesomer.
</p>

<p>
A testimonial could come in handy, especially if it's on an attributed
site like LinkedIn.
</p>

<p>
But really, it's more about long-term relationships and helping out
good people, good teams, and good causes. Since I can choose how much
to work and I know that my non-work activities are also valuable, the
main reasons I would choose to work more instead of exploring those
other interests are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I like the people I work with and what they're working on, and I want to support them,
</li>
<li>I'll learn interesting things along the way, and
</li>
<li>It's good to honour commitments and not disrupt plans unnecessarily.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So, theoretically, if we plunged right back into the thick of another
project, I didn't get the time to write about stuff, I didn't feel
right keeping personal notes (and thus I'll end up forgetting the
important parts of the previous project), and no one's allowed to
write testimonials, I'd still be okay with good karma - not the
quid-pro-quo of transactional favour-swapping, but a general good
feeling that might come in handy thirty years from now.
</p>

<p>
Hmm, this is somewhat related to my reflection on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/09/fit-for-you-thinking-about-my-priorities/">Fit for You</a> - which
I thought I'd updated within the last three years, but I guess I
hadn't posted that to my blog. Should reflect on that again
sometime&#x2026; Anyway, it's good to put together a "care and feeding"
guide for yourself! =)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-661">
<p>
I still get a kick out of walking into and out of a clinic without
paying anything, just providing my Ontario health card at the
appropriate moments. Canada's public health system covers a lot of
stuff. Not everything, though! W-'s extended health plan from work
covers a large portion of many expenses, like dental care and
massages.
</p>

<p>
For the expenses that W-'s health plan doesn't cover, I looked into
setting up a private health services plan (PHSP) so that I can pay for
the remainder through my business. After some quick research, I found
<a href="https://brockhealth.ca/">Brock Health</a> was a popular choice for small corporations in Canada.
The way that it works is that you send them the paperwork for the
claim, and your corporation pays them the amount of the claim plus an
administration fee. They then send you (as the employee or corporation
owner) a reimbursement of the expenses without the admin fee. This is
tax-free on your personal income, and is paid with before-tax business
dollars. So you pay a little more because of the admin fee, but it
works out.
</p>

<p>
I set up an account last fiscal year. Based on my calculations,
claiming expenses on our tax forms first made more sense last year, so
I didn't have any transactions. This year, my calculations showed that
the PHSP might be a better way to do things. I sent in my first claim
with a couple of void cheques in order to It turned out that one of
the expenses was partially refunded. I called Brock Health to update
the claim, and they updated it before processing the cheques.
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward to seeing how it all works out in this year's
business tax return. If it's as simple as I think it might be, my
personal health plan might include more massages&#x2026; =)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-665">
<p>
Sometimes people tell me that they can’t believe I’m introverted. You
organize meetups, they say. You share a lot online. You can’t possibly
be introverted. Not only do I need to recharge after conferences or
other intense social interactions, I like being introverted – it’s
good to be comfortable with yourself. That said, you learn a lot when
you bump into other people, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to
have more of those serendipitous conversations.
</p>

<p>
I like group conversations more than one-on-ones because I get to
learn from the intersections of people’s interests. I see different
aspects of people than I might bring out on my own. Group
conversations also reduce the pressure to carry the conversation
myself – people bring their own questions and tips and ideas to the
table.
</p>

<p>
I’m particularly interested in virtual meetups because there are so
many wonderful people out there whom I will probably never be in the
same city with. Toronto is a great meetup city because there’s always
something going on, but there’s no reason why knowledge-sharing should
be unnecessarily privileged or limited by geographic proximity. If
people are curious about blogging, drawing, Emacs, Quantified Self, or
whatever we have in common, maybe we can have virtual show-and-tells
instead of relying on the probability of finding critical mass for a
meetup in our own areas.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
I get my energy from a quiet and simple life. I’ve learned to say no
when I need more space: no if I need quiet instead of networking (even
if there could be someone who could change my life or vice versa just
over there); no if I need silence instead of a taxi cab conversation;
no to people’s requests in favour of spending time with W- or on my
own projects.
</p>

<p>
It’s hard to learn how to say no, or even to learn that you can. “Say
yes to everything,” the advice goes. Seize the day. Grab those
opportunities.
</p>

<p>
But there’s a lot of power in being able to listen to your needs and
carve out the time and space that you need—to meet the world on your
own terms, and to be happy to give because you’re ready to do so.

<p>
I try to minimize the number of things I’ve promised to other people
so that I have the flexibility to follow opportunities when they come
up. Conversations are an exception. It’s hard to not schedule those if
I want to make sure they happen at some point. Left to my own devices,
I might never get around to talking to people. So I pay someone a
small amount to handle my scheduling, which neatly removes me from the
back-and-forth hassles of coordinating times and also (useful and
possibly more important!) prevents me from giving myself excuses not
to do it. Then I remind myself that getting to and from these
appointments is either reading time or free exercise (for in-person
meetings), or possible podcast or blog material (if online). Introvert
hack. =)

</p>

<p>
Sometimes I hear from people who are having a hard time finding a job
or clients for their business, working on establish healthier habits,
or sorting out their finances. The Internet tells me that people who
are struggling generally don't need <i>more</i> advice, since they've been
told by everyone else around them to apply to jobs, go to events,
exercise, lose weight, stop eating junk food, stop buying coffee, etc.
In fact, we should probably stop asking how things are going and stop
trying to solve people's problems for them. Ditch the clichés, too.
Sympathy, encouragement, support, and maybe even a little distraction
are apparently the way to go.
</p>

<p>
It got me thinking about different purposes for conversation, and how
to match someone's purpose better. Mismatches can lead to frustration
on both sides, like when you're really looking for advice and
different perspectives and someone fobs you off with "You can do it!",
or when you're feeling like this situation will never end and someone
passes on a piece of trite advice that you'd already tried on day 1,
or when someone just wants to talk and you jump in with a
problem-solving mindset.
</p>

<p>
It feels a little weird to explicitly talk about what people are
looking for in a conversation, but what if clarifying that up front
can lead to a more effective exchange? You could minimize those
mismatches or even direct people onward if you're not in the right
space for a conversation. For example, although people have told me
that they appreciate how positive I am (which is good for when people
need encouragement), I catch myself becoming impatient if people just
want to vent without taking action. I'm much better with breaking down
big challenges, finding alternative approaches, and celebrating small
steps forward (even if they're minuscule). I read extensively, so I
can tell people some common approaches to different life challenges,
but I don't have a lot of personal experiences because my life has
been pretty straightforward.
</p>

<p>
There are so many different kinds of conversations, so I'll keep the
scope of this reflection manageable by focusing only on the
conversations where someone has started by describing a problem.
What are some of the things people look for, and how do I want to respond?
</p>

<p>
<b>Advice (rarely)</b>: "You should&#x2026;" is a common response when people
share what they're going through. People rarely need additional
information, but oddly enough, they get spades of it (even
unsolicited). It's not like it's difficult to search the Internet or
find books about different life challenges&#x2026; and yet it's so tempting
to fall into the trap of thinking that just a little more knowledge
will help people solve their problems.
</p>

<p>
I've been curbing the impulse to give advice by reminding myself that
people are generally smart and usually try everything before asking
for help. Instead of "You should&#x2026;", I often phrase things as "You've
probably &#x2026;. How did that go?" If they hadn't done it yet, I ask
what's been getting in their way. I rarely have experience with the
particular situation they're in, but barriers tend to be common, so I
can share how I've dealt with those - not in a "You should" way, but
rather "Here's what I tried and what worked for me."
</p>

<p>
<b>Acknowledgement</b>: Sometimes people just want someone to see them and
know what they're going through. This is the "Oh, you poor dear; let's
have some ice cream and you can tell me all about it" sort of thing, I
think. Active listening techniques (restating, etc.) can help here.
I'm not particularly good at this yet, but I might get better at this
by focusing on the interestingness of people.
</p>

<p>
<b>Distraction</b>: Sometimes you just want to have fun and take your mind
off stuff. Like acknowledgement, but this time you're having ice cream
and watching your favourite movies or something like that. I'm not
particularly good at this yet, but I can get better at this by asking
people what they want to do.
</p>

<p>
<b>Encouragement and celebration</b>: "I'm in a sucky situation, but I'm
working on it. I'm making slow progress, but I'm making progress!"
"Woohoo! You can do it!" is sort of how this conversation goes. It's
like acknowledgement, but people are moving forward instead of getting
stuck. I like cheering people on, and I might be able to do even
better by helping people track their progress so that they can see how
they're doing over time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Thinking out loud</b>: I often find myself understanding things better
when I explain them either to myself (through blogging) or to other
people. Conversation is great for making sense of and making peace
with things. People can ask questions to probe your reasoning and
direct your thinking, helping you deepen your understanding.
</p>

<p>
Active listening and thoughtful questions can help. For my part, I can
see it as a way to learn from other people's lives and thought
processes, so there's a lot of benefit in doing this too. Learning
about therapy might help here.
</p>

<p>
<b>Poking holes (rarely)</b>: "I'm going to &#x2026;" "That might not work
because of &#x2026;. Have you thought about &#x2026;? What about &#x2026;?" It's
mind-boggling how many people have this as their default reaction,
actually - probably second to advice. My parents used to struggle with
this a lot, because my dad would come up with wild ideas and my mom
would immediately have her "How would we make this actually work?" hat on.
I hardly ever do this with other people, although I do this myself to
test scenarios: come up with ideas, then put on the "What could go
wrong?" hat and poke holes, then update the plans to address those
holes.
</p>

<p>
It's probably better to assume people are <b>not</b> looking for this
unless they explicitly ask for it. If people do want this, I like
approaching it from a "Let's make the plan better" perspective rather
than the "You suck at planning" perspective.
</p>

<p>
<b>Accountability</b>: It can be easier to take action or change habits
when you publicly commit to that, and having a friend follow up with
you and keep you accountable can help a lot. I do okay with this,
although I don't actually enforce anything in case people miss their
goals. (Perhaps I should start insisting on some kind of consequence -
maybe ice cream.) Learning about coaching techniques might help here too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Different perspectives</b>: "I'm in this situation and I think you've
been in something similar. How did you solve it?" is the gist of this
conversation. Sometimes knowing that something is possible (because
someone you can identify with succeeded at it!) is enough to give you
the strength to get through the situation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requesting help</b>: This is where you're asking for help. Requesting
specific favours do well, I think, because that makes it easier for
other people to recognize situations in which they can help you.
That's why it's good to describe your ideal client and ask friends to
keep an eye out for people matching that description, describe your
ideal contact and ask people to check their networks, etc.
</p>

<p>
I feel like my network is not as plugged-in as it could be in terms of
business owners and potential clients for friends. I probably need to
meet more people who need stuff! Hmm, actually, the input part works
pretty well in terms of sketchnoting/graphic recording - I get the
occasional request that I can forward to other people. In other areas,
I can usually point people to other people who have experience in the
kinds of things they want to do and the meetups to check out, so I
guess that's something. There's room to work on this, though! Time to
go to more events and connect with more people. Although come to think
of it, that's not actually the thing that worked for me in
sketchnoting - maybe I'll focus more on creating useful stuff, and go
to a few events for serendipity.
</p>

<p>
Acknowledgement, distraction, encouragement, thinking out loud, poking
holes, accountability, different perspectives, requesting help&#x2026; What
other purposes have you noticed when you talk to people about life's
challenges?

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Collins in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (Jane Austen)
</p>

<p>
After three successive weekends (three!) with parties, I want to think about small talk and how I can tweak it. Small talk is unavoidable, but there are things you can do to nudge it one way or another. I like having conversations that move me or other people forward, even if it's just by a little bit.
</p>

<p>
So, what do I want to do with small talk?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Help other people feel comfortable enough to open up about some memorable interest or quirk
</li>
<li>Find topics of common interest for further conversation
</li>
<li>Find a way to help or a reason to follow up
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We could do the ritualistic weather/profession/how-do-you-know-the-host conversations, or we could change the level of the conversation so that it goes beyond the repetitive gestures that only skim the surface. I could chat as a way of passing time (possibly bumping into interesting thoughts along the way), or I can more deliberately check for things I'm interested in while staying open to the serendipity of random connections. What do I want to be able to frequently do through conversation?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify possible meetup or global community members - reassure them that this is a thing and that lots of people are interested in it; point people to resources (Emacs, QS, visual thinking)
</li>
<li>Talk shop with other geeks to find out about tech and business things worth looking into
</li>
<li>Other geeks (non-tech): learn more about different fields
</li>
<li>Non-geeks: See if there's anything I can help with easily (books? ideas?)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I could either dig into people's interests or be memorable enough so that people look me up afterwards. Many people open up about their interests only when they feel comfortable. What makes people feel more comfortable? It helps to establish a sense of similarity and shared understanding.
</p>

<p>
People have different strategies for establishing similarity. I know a few people who use the "You look really familiar&#x2026;" approach (even if the other person doesn't) because rattling off schools, companies, associations, and interests tends to reveal something in common.
</p>

<p>
I like building on stuff I've overheard or asking questions about common context. That's one of the reasons why I like events with presentations more than events that are focused only on networking - the presentation gives us something to start talking about.
</p>

<p>
In terms of helping people get to know me and find topics of shared interest, I use short disclosures with high information value.
</p>

<p>
<b>Consulting:</b> "I'm a consultant" has low information value: it's vague and it wouldn't establish much similarity even if the other person was also a consultant. I rarely use it unless I'm tired, I want to shift the focus back on the other person quickly, or I sense they're also going through the motions. (Or I want to see at what point their eyes glaze over&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
<b>Emacs:</b> "I'm working on some Emacs projects" has high information value when talking to tech geeks, almost like a secret handshake that lets us shift the conversation. (I talk faster, go into more detail, and use more jargon when talking to fellow geeks, so it's almost like the 56kbps modem handshake.) I'm female, I don't wear geeky T-shirts, and I don't work for a technical company or in a technical position, so it helps to verbally establish geek cred quickly without making a big deal out of it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Data analysis</b>: For geeks of other fields, Emacs is low-information, but Quantified Self and data analysis seems to be a good way to establish that similarity quickly. It works well with people who are interested in science, tech, engineering, math, or even continuous improvement. Litter box analysis is surprisingly engaging as a cocktail party topic, or at least it's easy to for people to ask follow-up questions about if they want to.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sketchnoting</b>: People (including most of the ones who don't identify as geeks) tend to be curious about my sketchnoting, since it's visual, easy to understand, and uncommon. That said, I need to get better at handling the usual follow-ups. People tend to say things like "You draw so well" or "I could never do something like that." I want to nip that in the bud and get people to realize that they can do this too. Pointing out that I draw stick figures like a 5-year-old doesn't seem to do the trick ("Ah, but you know what to leave out" and "But you're doing this while listening - that's hard"). Maybe a little humour, poking fun at the idea of going to an art school that specializes in stick figures or learning how to not fall asleep in presentations? About one in fifty people I talk to recognizes this as something they do on their own or that they want to do, and it's good to link them up with the global community. For most people, though, I feel slightly more comfortable focusing on ideas they want t olearn more about and sending them sketchnotes if there's a fit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Semi-retirement</b>: This experiment with semi-retirement can be a good conversational hook for prompting curiosity. It usually follows this sequence: semi-retired -&gt; "aren't you a little young? what do you mean?" -&gt; tracked, saved up, experimenting. It tends to be too detached from people's lives, though - many people don't think they can pull it off, even experienced freelancers who are doing most of it already.
</p>

<p>
<b>Variety</b>: If I don't know how someone identifies, it's fun to answer the "What do you do?" question (which tries to pigeonhole someone into a neatly understandable job title) with a sense of variety: "I do a lot of different things! This week, I &#x2026;"
</p>

<p>
<b>Going forward</b>
</p>

<p>
For the next few events, I think I'll experiment with doing the tech/non-tech/non-geek identification earlier, or going into that with an opening based on variety. I could name an example each for tech, non-tech, and non-geek, and see which one they dig into. As for digging into people's interests, maybe an open-ended survey-type question would be an interesting way to help people open up while still collecting data in case people haven't thought about how to make themselves easier to get to know. Hmm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Small talk might be small, but if I have thousands of conversations over the years, I might as well keep learning from it. How have you tweaked how you do small talk?

</p>

<p>
After reflecting on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/07/what-are-people-looking-for-talk-challenges/">how I'd like to respond to people who want to talk
about their challenges and how I want to discuss mine</a>, I've been
thinking a little bit more about the approaches that I favour and why.
</p>

<p>
Despite my faith in friends and availability of support groups or
forums for pretty much any situation one can find yourself in, I tend
to work through things independently. Sometimes I talk to W-. Even
then, it's often retrospective: "I worked through this-and-this
dilemma. This is the decision I've come to because of these reasons,
but I'd love to hear your thoughts in case I missed something." I'd
rather talk to people about the good stuff.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to other people talking to me about stuff they're going
through, I assume they're smart and have tried things, so I ask
questions about the obstacles they've run into. I like focusing on
getting over barriers because this is one thing that other people
<i>can</i> actually help with. You might get stuck on something because you
don't know where to start, don't have the skills or experience for it,
or because it intimidates you. Other people might be able to map out
an easier way for you, directly help you (hooray for comparative
advantage), or share how it's really not that scary if you focus on
doing X, Y, and Z.
</p>

<p>
While reading D.P. Chase's translation of Aristotle's <i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>, I came across this passage on what to share with your friends
when you're going through challenges:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But [friends'] presence has probably a mixed effect: I mean, not only is
the very seeing friends pleasant, especially to one in misfortune, and
actual help towards lessening the grief is afforded (the natural
tendency of a friend, if he is gifted with tact, being to comfort by
look and word, because he is well acquainted with the sufferer's
temper and disposition and therefore knows what things give him
pleasure and pain), but also the perceiving a friend to be grieved at
his misfortunes causes the sufferer pain, because every one avoids
being cause of pain to his friends. And for this reason they who are
of a manly nature are cautious not to implicate their friends in their
pain; and unless a man is exceedingly callous to the pain of others he
cannot bear the pain which is thus caused to his friends: in short, he
does not admit men to wail with him, not being given to wail at all:
women, it is true, and men who resemble women, like to have others to
groan with them, and love such as friends and sympathisers. But it is
plain that it is our duty in all things to imitate the highest
character.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So if you're sad, it can help to have company in your sadness, but
that might cause your friends to feel sad as well. Be strong, if you can.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It would seem, therefore, that we ought to call in friends readily on
occasion of good fortune, because it is noble to be ready to do good
to others: but on occasion of bad fortune, we should do so with
reluctance; for we should as little as possible make others share in
our ills; on which principle goes the saying, "I am unfortunate, let
that suffice." The most proper occasion for calling them in is when
with small trouble or annoyance to themselves they can be of very
great use to the person who needs them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's probably going to be my approach to getting by with a little
help from my friends: to figure out, perhaps, if there are small
things people can do that could have a big impact, and to focus on
those instead of on commiseration. As for when people approach me, or
when I notice friends in difficult situations, I will try to keep this
in mind:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But, on the contrary, it is fitting perhaps to go to one's friends in
their misfortunes unasked and with alacrity (because kindness is the
friend's office and specially towards those who are in need and who do
not demand it as a right, this being more creditable and more pleasant
to both); and on occasion of their good fortune to go readily, if we
can forward it in any way (because men need their friends for this
likewise), but to be backward in sharing it, any great eagerness to
receive advantage not being creditable.

<p>
&#x2026; to see the opportunity to be kind, where kindness might be cooking
a good meal, giving a person a hug, or helping out in ways that take
advantage of our different skills and experiences.

I told W- about the <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/ethiopian-cabbage-dish/">Ethiopian cabbage dish</a> that Eric and I made at
Tuesday's open house at Hacklab, to go with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injera">injera</a> that we bought
from a store a few doors down from Hacklab. We had decided to go with
cooking Ethiopian food because it was a cool day (so, a warm meal), we
hadn't cooked anything Ethiopian before, and Eric had mentioned the
injera previously; so we looked online for vegan Ethiopian recipes and
picked a simple one to start with. A typical Ethiopian meal includes
several kinds of stews served on top of the flatbread, but we figured
it was fine to start with just one recipe and let people decide how
they want to eat it. It worked out pretty well, although there were a
few moments when we weren't quite sure how to fit all that shredded
cabbage in. (Eric picked the biggest head of cabbage, I think!) $16 of
groceries fed lots of people, and there were still leftovers by the
time I left.
</p>

<p>
W- asked, "How come you're not as experimental when cooking at home?"
Come to think of it, I tend to test recipes at Hacklab before trying
them at home: gazpacho, Thai curry, Japanese curry&#x2026; Cooking at
Hacklab is fun because other people help (getting that second chef's
knife for Hacklab was totally worth it!) and the meals disappear
pretty quickly.
</p>

<p>
But we're even better set up to experiment at home. Proper chopping
boards, all the pots and pans I need, no worries about extra
ingredients or leftovers, and backup plans in case things go wrong&#x2026;
Slightly pickier eaters, but if I mess up, I can always pack it in the
freezer for later, or even toss it out if I really have to. (I tend to
have more tolerance for cooking than I should, although even I have
had to give up on some attempts before. Ah well!)
</p>

<p>
W- is much more experienced at cooking than I am, so I'm catching up
by exploring different recipes. Cooking has become a hobby for me -
something I enjoy for its own sake, even if I'm still working on
getting better at it. It's even more fun when you're cooking with
someone, since you can laugh at stuff and swap stories. Sometimes W-
and I cook together, although I guess lately I've been trying to do
most of the household prep so that he can focus on work. Choosing the
recipe is part of the fun, and making something often results in funny
stories even if there are hiccups along the way (<i>especially</i> if there
are!). Maybe we'll just make a habit of trying one new recipe a week.
Between that and Hacklab, I'll be learning tons of recipes, yay!
</p>

<p>
Mmm&#x2026; What do I want to try? Different kinds of pasta, for J-.
Curries of the world! Salads for summer, both cold and warm! Mmm&#x2026;

<p>
I joined <a href="http://hacklab.to/">Hacklab</a> (a small makerspace here in Toronto) <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/02/thinking-about-joining-hacklab-to/">early in 2013</a>. I
thought of it mostly as a way to meet people who are working on
interesting projects, hang out, and learn together. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/10/decision-review-seven-months-hacklab/">It's been working
out well,</a> and I'm gradually getting into helping the community more.
</p>

<p>
Hacklab hosts an open house every Tuesday evening. It's a good
opportunity for prospective members to check out the place and chat
with people about their projects. We usually put together a vegan
dinner donated by the person cooking it so that it's free for the
members and guests (although sometimes people pitch in for groceries).
There's no fixed schedule; people just volunteer to cook whenever they
want. When I'm there, I often volunteer. I treat it as a vegan cooking
lesson / soup kitchen / party. Sure, I'm teaching myself, but it's
still an excuse to try new recipes. I think the people there are worth
supporting, and cooking is a much more efficient use of money than
having people go out to dinner. Besides, other people often help with
preparing the ingredients, and we can chat while doing so.
</p>

<p>
Here are some easy dishes that we can make with ingredients from
nearby grocery stories:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gazpacho: tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, garlic; serve with bread
</li>
<li>Pasta salad: peas, tomatoes, olives, cucumbers
</li>
<li>Curry: potatoes, carrots, green beans, tofu, onions; there are
plenty of spices in the cabinet
</li>
<li>Ratatouille: potatoes, zucchini, peppers, onions, garlic; serve with
bread
</li>
<li>Lentil dal: tomatoes, lentils, ginger, garlic, onions
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think I'll make recipe cards with serving numbers and cost
estimates. That will probably make it easier to come up with dinners
on the fly, and it might encourage other people to cook too.
</p>

<p>
We've been slowly improving the Hacklab kitchen. The addition of pots,
a rice cooker, and lots of cutlery helped a lot. (It was difficult to
cook and serve before those things!) Last week, I replaced the rather
ineffective and hadn't-been-washed-in-ages kitchen towels with two
sets I'd made from some fabric we had at home. I'll add the towels to
our weekly laundry cycle, so things actually get washed. Storage is
still an issue. The fridge is used mostly for drinks, so we try to not
have any left-over ingredients or servings.
</p>

<p>
I'm not currently working on super-geeky projects that involve other
members or the equipment that's there. (It would be interesting to do
more with the laser cutter, 3D printers, or the new mill!) But cooking
gives me a way to help other people, so that's something.
</p>

<p>
I think I like this approach of taking responsibility for making
Hacklab a little bit better for people. You get as much out of a
community as you put in, and these little domestic touches can help
make a place feel more like home. (I'm going to keep nudging people to
put their dishes in the dishwasher, though! ;) )

Every so often, I go through my list and remove plugins I don't use as much in order to reduce memory use and improve security. Still, with thousands of plugins available on <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins</a>, there are always more ways to make blogs better. (Come to think of it, I should probably add a SEO-focused plugin too. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> seems popular&#x2026;) Hope this list of favourites helps!

It's getting cooler here in Toronto, with possible snow showers and
scattered flurries this weekend. Time to think about how I can make
this winter even better!
</p>

<p>
The Scott Quest Vest is working out really well, allowing me to leave
my belt bag behind. I haven't quite gotten the hang of all the
pockets, but I can generally find the most frequent things I use. One
of the earphone loops has worked loose and gotten frayed by nearby
Velcro, though. I'll check with the manufacturer, since I haven't
figured out how to securely hand-sew elastic loops like that.
</p>

<p>
I've started wearing my thermals again. With that, the vest, and maybe
a sweater, I'm pretty okay with the 5-10C temperatures these days. A
rain jacket is handy, too. A hoodie and maybe gloves will take me down
to 3C or so.
</p>

<p>
Here are some notes I put together while thinking about what kind of coat I wanted to get this year:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../Inbox/To blog/2014-10-11 Considering winter coats.png" alt="2014-10-11 Considering winter coats.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I ended up deciding on a waterproof jacket with an interchangable
lining that's compatible with a down jacket. I'm still keeping an eye
out for a large, warm hat, but I can probably get by with a nice warm
scarf and my winter hats. It turns out that I'm somewhat picky about
hats, so I haven't quite found the one I like the most yet.
</p>

<p>
The new office my clients have moved to is directly connected to the
PATH, so my winter exposure during consulting days will just be the
10-20 minute walk to the subway station. I plan to be at Hacklab more
often, though, so that will still involve a bit of waiting. The new
Hacklab has nicely vivid accent colours, so I'll probably head over
there if I feel colour-deprived.
</p>


<p>
I probably need to get new winter boots. I noticed last year that my
insulated boots were no longer waterproof. The shoe stores don't seem
to have brought in their winter boot selections yet, but I'll check
again in a few months. I tried looking for winter boots at
end-of-season sales earlier this year, but since I have small feet and
a preference for simple styles, the sizes tend to be sold out quickly.
I had the same problem with coats, too, which is why I decided to get
a new coat early in the season instead of waiting to see what the rest
of the options were.
</p>

<p>
Compared to last year, I'm even more comfortable with cooking and
baking, and I'm looking forward to keeping the house warm and the
fridge full.
</p>

<p>
Bring it on!

The weather finally warmed up last weekend. W- and I raked the back
yard, and I started planting seeds that would likely survive just in
case we get another frost. Spinach, peas, lettuce&#x2026; I don't know how
well the seeds will do, but I want to get things growing again. I
can't grow anything indoors because the cats love nibbling on greens,
so I'll just have to buy my tomato and basil starts from the garden
centres. In the meantime, though, I can experiment with seeds.
</p>

<p>
The soil feels better now than the sandy mix we started with, although
there's always room for improvement. We've added lots of compost to it
over the years &#x2013; mostly manure, but there was a year that <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/06/hungry-hungry-compost-and-other-garden-updates/">our compost
heap was active enough to steam</a>. <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9ffed187c3b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=b31d433112b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextfmt=default">Toronto gives away leaf compost</a> every
Saturday, so we might check that out too. We're thinking about
ordering compost in bulk this year instead of getting bagged manure
from the store. I'll probably put in the compost around the time that
we clear out the peas and get started with tomatoes, so I can get some sprouts going while waiting to sort all of that out.
</p>

<p>
What am I going to change this year? Here are my notes from October 2013:
</p>

<p>
I changed my mind about irrigation. I think I'll start by
hand-watering the plants. It's not that hard to do, and I've marked
the rows a little more clearly now so I know what to expect. I
probably won't pay for a landscaping or gardening company. Maybe I can
share more notes on our garden and ask folks for tips. I'm looking
forward to growing more greens and herbs, and giving bitter melon yet
another shot.
</p>

<p>
I planted the first batch of seeds this weekend, going through many of the leftover seeds from 1-2 years ago. After all, the seeds aren't going to get any fresher, so I may as well plant them and see what sticks. Some of them germinate in a week, so let's see if there'll be any progress.
</p>

<p>
Yay growing things! (Well, eventually. =) )

:Effort:   1:00
</p>

<p>
I patched a big pinch flat in my front tire yesterday. Apparently not
well enough, or maybe there's another leak (even though I checked the
tire with water). The bike was flat again this morning. Ah well. I can
write just as well from home as I can from Hacklab or other places.
Besides, there are several libraries nearby if I want airconditioning
and ambient noise.
</p>

<p>
The etymology for the Dutch word for bicycle (<i>fiets</i>) apparently has
something to do with it being a "substitute horse" (source: Dutch
friend, although <a href="http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/week-sci-ed-29022012">this</a> says something similar too). I think about that
every time I maintain my bike. It amuses me to think of this as taking
care of my substitute horse, minus expenses of feed and livery and the
chores of mucking things out. It's also a darn sight cheaper than car
insurance, not to mention gas.
</p>

<p>
I bought this bicycle in 2009. Since then, I've saved more than its
cost in public transit tokens.

<h3 id="unnumbered-719">Amping up this homebody lifestyle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-719">
<p>
W- and I are both homebodies. We like spending time at home instead of
going out to eat, shop, or be entertained, although we do go out
occasionally. There's so much to try and learn and do even at home,
though. We're nowhere near the limits of what's possible.
</p>

<p>
If I'm more inclined towards the homebody lifestyle by nature, how can
I make the most of it? What would an amazing homebody life be like for
us?
</p>

<p>
<b>Shelter:</b> I've been helping with more of the household maintenance tasks. That way, W- can have more free time in the future, and I can pick up some practical skills. I'd like to work on my fitness a bit more (maybe make good progress on the introductory rungs of the Hacker's Diet exercise ladder), and then maybe I'll try volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in order to pick up more DIY skills there too.
</p>

<p>
We finally moved our Adirondack chairs (<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/06/the-fruits-and-chairs-of-our-labour/">the ones we made ourselves!</a> =) ) out of the shed and onto the deck. I think I'll enjoy dinners on the deck, and maybe some reading and drawing out there as well. Plenty of light, and the chairs are wonderfully comfortable.
</p>

<p>
<b>Food:</b> We're pretty happy with our cooking repertoire, but it would be good to learn more recipes and to get even better at preparing the ones we know. I made gazpacho recently (super-easy with the food processor!) and that was perfect for the summer heat. If I look into more vegetable-focused dishes, I can use those recipes for Hacklab open houses too.
</p>

<p>
In terms of cooking,
</p>

<p>
<b>Reading:</b> I can start by reading all the books in the house, since W- has quite a few that I haven't even opened. I also have quite a few books that I haven't taken detailed notes on yet. Then I can pick one of those "Books You Should Read" lists and go through them all. In some fields, I'm starting to get a sense of the conversation that happens among authors, and I like that.

<h3 id="unnumbered-720"><span class="done DONE">DONE</span> Homebody</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-720">
<p>
Saturday afternoon. It had started raining, so W- put away his tools and stopped working on the deck stairs. He asked if I wanted to go out and do something fun – maybe watch a movie, or have pho?
</p>

<p>
I checked the movie listings. Nothing particularly worth watching on the big screen instead of on our television, and we had food in the fridge. So we stayed home, watched one of the movies we’d checked out from the library, and enjoyed some home-made pizza.
</p>

<p>
We haven’t been to a movie theatre in ages (ever since I decided that actually, even superhero blockbusters are just fine on the small screen). The library is the source of a constant stream of DVDs. While there are long waits for the latest releases, there are plenty of old movies we can go through. I’ve gotten accustomed to watching with subtitles and the ability to pause or rewind, which is great since many movies involve at least one mumbly moment. Besides, if we watch at home, we can make jokes.
</p>

<p>
I am such a homebody. My default is to spend time at home, and I enjoy it. I love reading, writing, drawing, coding. Tidying up is slightly less fun, but it’s also useful. We’re not hermits – we go to the supermarket, the library, the hardware store – but we don’t often go out just for recreation.
</p>

<p>
I go out occasionally – more often than W- goes out. I go to the clients’ offices. I go to HackLab to hang out with other geeks and learn from them. I go to friends’ get-togethers. And then I come home and recharge.
</p>

<p>
Back when I lived at home, my parents took me and my sisters out a lot: eating at restaurants, strolling through the malls. I hardly go shopping here, aside from the occasional stressful sprint when I need to restock my shoes or clothes. I hardly go to restaurants, either. When I get together with friends, it’s usually in someone’s kitchen.
</p>

<p>
I think the trick is to embrace it instead of wondering what other people are doing.

Since she doesn’t like taking classes or workshops, she can use that
time to get better at teaching herself. I don’t like taking classes
either, so I know what that’s like. I should probably hack my way
around that, though. There are many things that might be more cost- or
time-effective for me to learn in a class than on my own or from
books.

When I project my current paths out to their peaks, I learn a lot about where I want to go and how I want to get there. For example, I'm currently learning about sales by selling sketchnoting services. I'm starting with that because it's relatively easy to appreciate (yay visuals!), there are established companies in other geographies that have tested the business model and value proposition, and people want it. There's a lot of room to grow. If I imagine being a super-sketchnoter or a super-illustrator, though, I feel like there's something missing. I feel like the focus is on interpreting someone else's ideas instead of creating something marvelous and new. Artists create new things, and there's something fascinating in that.

I like making contingency plans. It's like peeking up a manifold of
possibilities, imagining a sure-footed Sacha capably dealing with
whatever comes down the pipe.
</p>

<p>
In preparation for a recent event, I made a list of different things
that could go wrong, highlighting specific scenarios I needed to worry
about and listing a few catch-all scenarios as well. Amusingly enough,
the actual challenges that came up (Windows updates, network/hardware
latency, a network configuration reset, Powerpoint crashes,
last-minute changes) weren't on my list as specific scenarios, but
they were addressed by our general back-up plans. I like the blend of
specific and general. Specific scenarios help you flush out questions
to ask and things to prepare, while general scenarios identify
characteristics to prepare for and help you come up with flexible
strategies. Both types help you minimize stress when things do happen.
Knowing that you have a backup plan, what the trade-offs are, and a
probable deadline for committing to that plan helps you worry less
about catastrophic failure and lets you focus on coming up with a
better ad-hoc option.
</p>

<p>
One of the things that I gained a better appreciation of was the
trade-off between preparing in advance and waiting until you can test
your hypotheses. For example, I wasn't sure if the server would be
able to accept incoming connections once at the venue. I could adapt
the code to run on my public webserver, but that would take a little
time. However, since we were likely to be able to get things to work
on the event network, I could postpone worrying about it to Sunday,
which meant that I could spend Saturday doing non-work things instead.
</p>

<p>
Outside work, I also have a lot of scenarios and contingency plans.
It's been interesting slowly moving through time, watching the
different uncertainties resolve themselves. Doors close and new
possibilities open up. Because I've scanned my personal notes and I've
blogged about many of my projections, I can recall a little bit of
what past-Sacha was thinking, standing on the threshold of the
unknown. I tend to overestimate risks and costs, but I'm good at
coming up with small tests and approaches. I'm good at tracking my
progress and keeping an eye out for "trip lines," little reminders to
myself to re-evaluate the situation. I want to get better at
generating more general scenarios and alternative approaches, and
properly evaluating risk/reward (maybe calibrating these with other
people's experiences). It's fun treating life as a Choose Your Own
Adventure where you might be able to peek ahead a little! =)

<p>
A few of my friends want to learn more about cooking, going beyond eating out or occasionally making a bowl of pasta at home. It’s a welcome change, and I’m looking forward to more and more people making that shift.
</p>

<p>
For some people, it seems a point of pride to not know how to cook: they’re too busy to sit down and do that, or there are so many good restaurants out there, or cooking is just plain not enjoyable. For us, cooking is part of our way of life. We can cook most meals for much cheaper than we can buy them, and our weekday meals are more convenient than eating out. I love being able to have my favourite foods at any time of day. Despite the occasional drudgery, I’ve grown to enjoy cooking – especially when W- and I spend a few hours putting together something delicious.
</p>

<p>
I thought I'd reflect on past 10 years of learning how to cook to see what I learned and how I learned it. When I started, I struggled with the basics: burning pancakes, trying to figure out how to use ground beef in different recipes. Now we can make lists based on the grocery fliers, adjust our plans based on what's marked down for quick sale, and stock our freezer with meals to last us through the week.
</p>

<h3>B.C. - Before Cooking</h3>

<p>
Growing up, I hadn't imagined being this comfortable with cooking. My sister was the cook in the family, the one with an intuitive sense of what went with what. She took whatever was in the fridge and made something delicious with it, no recipe required. We enjoyed the occasional meal she prepared for us, and she told us stories of how cooking helped her make friends while travelling. The rest of the time, we were spoiled by the fact that family business&#x2013;advertising photography&#x2013;retained a cook to feed clients, staff, and us.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't totally hopeless. I helped in the kitchen, and I loved making lasagna together with my mom. I took cooking lessons one summer. I mainly learned that following recipes produced reasonable results. At home, I occasionally made myself instant noodles or reheated pork and beans, but I didn't really have the motivation to cook.
</p>

<h3>Cook or Die</h3>

<p>
That changed a few months after I graduated from university. I had just turned twenty, and I was teaching computer science at my alma mater. To cut down on the commuting time, we found an apartment-style dormitory near the campus. Each unit was shared by two people, and there was an unfurnished kitchen. My parents outfitted it with a hot plate (a single electric burner, which was all the dormitory allowed), a toaster oven, a microwave, and a compact fridge.
There were a number of fast food restaurants in walking distance that I'd frequented as a student, but I resolved that my grown-up life shouldn't involve KFC every lunch and dinner. There was a supermarket a bit of the way up the street. To force myself to learn how to cook, I decided that I would eat out for at most one meal a day. If I didn't cook, I'd go hungry. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie/">Cook or die</a>. (Well, that was an exaggeration, but it was a good project name.)
</p>

<p>
Did I mention that my apartment didn't have Internet access? I know. Boggle.
</p>

<p>
It was&#x2026; interesting. I loaded up on kid- and singles- and microwave-oriented cookbooks, and occasionally made things up just as an experiment. You may find <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/cookordie/?order=asc">my blog posts from that time</a> amusing. Here's a summary of the first two weeks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
As you can see, I was a bit of a slow learner. ;)
</p>

<p>
Eventually I graduated to being confident enough in a few recipes that were ready for company. I was living in an exclusive girls' domitory, so no guys were allowed inside the units. That meant my friends could help me with groceries and give me tips, but they couldn't actually help me learn how to cook unless I was home for the weekend. The dormitory did have a garden with picnic tables and some shelter, though, and both male and female guests were welcome there. We worked out this weekly rotation, and I had dinner with someone practically every day. I particularly enjoyed being able to prepare individual-sized portions of lasagna rolls using the recipe in one of my microwave cookbooks. Even in pouring storms, friends would come and join me. It was wonderful.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed teaching, but I left that to take advantage of a technical internship that the Japanese government was offering. In the in-between months, I stayed at home. In Japan, I stayed at a hotel-type dormitory with a cafeteria. There was hardly any cooking, although I did develop an appreciation for the sheer variety of ramen (instant or otherwise) available in Japan.
</p>

<h3>Graduate student life</h3>

<p>
When I moved to Canada for graduate school, I made sure I was in an apartment-style residence with a kitchen and a small shared living room. I shared my unit with three other people, and the mix changed each semester or so. There was a 24-hour supermarket within walking distance (somewhat expensive, but convenient) and other markets available a long walk or a short streetcar ride down the street.
</p>

<p>
I made friends: some students who lived in the building, and other people I met in my studies or research. I often invited a couple of friends over for dinner, usually something experimental - a stir-fry, or chicken breast and sauce, or whatever recipe intrigued me. From time to time, I took advantage of the large common outdoor party/barbeque area.
At some point, I decided I was grown-up enough to want my own set of plates instead of the mismatched hand-me-downs, so I headed over to Walmart and splurged on a set of Corelle, a rice cooker, a teapot, and other essentials.
</p>

<p>
There were occasional group cooking lessons in the residence, open to whoever signed up. I liked them. We split up into small groups and prepared different recipes such as roasted red pepper soup, and then we got to enjoy the tastes of all the recipes together.
</p>

<p>
The administration decided on the mix of roommates based on the questionnaires we submitted. I didn't always get along with my room-mates, one of whom tended to abscond with my dishes without returning them. (I lost a couple of cereal bowls this way.) When I had finished most of my research and lined up a job at IBM, I decided it was time to look for my own apartment. Of all the ones I looked at, my favourite was a one-bedroom apartment across the street. The rent was a little high and the kitchen was <i>tiny</i>, but I was looking forward to cooking without squabbling over fridge space or dishes in the sink.
</p>

<h3>Cooking with W-</h3>

<p>
I was a relative newcomer to Canada, so the building management didn't want to prepare a lease without a co-signer. Of all my friends, W- was probably the stablest and most respectable. He knew I managed my finances well and had the year's rent set aside, so he didn't have to worry about being on the hook for it. In preparation for the move, I'd boxed up my kitchen tools and resolved to live on peanut butter sandwiches like my mom had done in university. W- took pity on me and invited me over for dinner. These scrumptious home-made meals became a regular occurrence.
</p>

<p>
We signed the paperwork and moved my stuff (easy across the street, especially with a skateboard), I feathered my nest and set up my tiny kitchen. As a housewarming present, W- gave me Happy Bunny socks with witty slogans, since I'd mentioned my sister's trick of happy socks. As a kitchen-warming present, he gave me a basic set of Wusthof Classic knives. (Embarrassed by the generosity of the gift, I tried to talk him out of it, but he insisted that good tools make all the difference.)
</p>

<p>
They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Apparently, this is true for women too. Even though the paperwork was done, W- kept inviting me for delicious meals: crushing basil in a mortar and pestle for pesto, pinakbet (which he had learned how to make long before meeting me, so it was fun to encounter this familiar dish), a comparison of two lasagna recipes. I assisted, of course: chopping, stirring, learning more about cooking. Sometimes I invited W- or other people over to my place for whatever simple dishes I could prepare with my minimal kitchen setup; the knives made preparation a joy even in the cramped space.
</p>

<p>
Eventually we realized we were in love. I sublet my apartment and moved in. I brought my cherished knives and selected kitchen tools, leaving the rest for my tenant.
</p>

<p>
After my tiny kitchen, W-'s kitchen was a real treat. Cast-iron skillets, a decent-sized wok, <i>two</i> rice cookers (large and small), a low-cost supermarket up the street, a garden to grow herbs in, a large kitchen table that we ended up spending most of our time at&#x2026; I volunteered to be the sous chef as often as I could. Over time, I took the lead in making more meals. I learned family favourites and we discovered new ones together. Cooking with W- made learning <i>fun</i> - we could celebrate successes and gamely finish anything that wasn't an absolute failure.
</p>

<p>
Cooking was part of W-'s way of life, and I was delighted to make it part of mine too. We rarely ate out. It just wasn't convenient during schooldays, and cooking was more frugal anyway. From March 2007 to August 2009 (30 months), I logged $145/month for groceries for 2.5 people (85%) and $25/month for dining out (15%). The actual numbers are different because W- picked up some groceries and usually treated me when dining out, although we set up this system where I contributed a fixed amount to household expenses so it worked out anyway.
</p>

<p>
We periodically tweaked the kitchen to improve the way we worked. We moved the canned goods from the basement into an industrial-style shelving unit. We moved the microwave to a custom shelf and freed up the rolling table it had been on, which turned out to have an excellent cutting surface on top of it - more counter space! Little tweaks like that made cooking more efficient and more fun.
</p>

<p>
I'd been reading about the benefits of a chest freezer on frugality blogs. We weren't sure if we had the space or if we could make it part of our lifestyle, so we dithered. In 2009, W- and I finally decided to take the plunge. We bought a 5.3 cu-ft freezer and started stocking it with sale items, filling the extra space with water jugs to improve efficiency. Eventually we learned the basics of bulk cooking, discovered which of our favourites froze well, and standardized our food containers for easier organization.
</p>

<p>
We also experimented with community-supported agriculture. It was a
good way to get through lots of vegetables, and Internet recipes were
really helpful. (All that zucchini! All that cabbage!) We eventually
decided to buy our own vegetables, but it was a good experience.
</p>

<p>
Now I've gotten to the point where a 30% markdown on pork tenderloin makes me think of tonkatsu, I can make a stir-fry with whatever vegetables look okay, and cooking is more like fun than a chore.
</p>

<h3>What I learned along the way</h3>

<p>
<b>People make cooking much more fun</b>
</p>

<p>
Cooking by myself was a drag. Cooking for other people was better, because we could enjoy the good stuff and laugh about the dishes that didn't go as well. (You can tell who your friends are - if they eat your experimental cooking, they're good friends!) Cooking <i>with</i> other people was the best, because then you can chat while chopping (carefully) and watch out for each other (looks like the eggs are done!). W- helped me learn so much more about cooking than I probably would have on my own.
</p>

<p>
<b>Good tools really do matter</b>
</p>

<p>
A sharp knife is less dangerous than a dull one because a sharp knife won't slip. W- periodically sharpens the knives, and I try to remember to use the steel before I use the chef's knife. I've also come to really appreciate the convenience of a dough scraper, Microplane graters, and other little kitchen things. That said, we try to minimize the number of unitaskers we have: no egg poachers, no slot toasters, no corn cob holders&#x2026; This means our drawers are easier to organize and keep uncluttered.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Internet is awesome</b>
</p>

<p>
The Internet has a gazillion recipes. I used to feel a little intimidated by the variety, but I realized that it meant that recipes are (mostly) just guidelines. Can I skip a spice that I don't normally stock? Can I substitute an ingredient for something I don't have? Do I want to adjust the temperature so that I can bake two different things at the same time? Chances are that someone has a recipe that calls for that, so it should be fine. It might not be amazing, but it will be okay.
</p>

<p>
<b>Absolute failures are very rare</b>
</p>

<p>
There was the time I put the yeast in water that was too hot. My lump of pizza dough didn't rise, and I had to throw it out and start over. Sometimes I burn things and have to scrape off bits. One time I was learning about seasoning cast-iron pans and I heated one for so long that the season flaked off. I broke a rice cooker and repaired it by replacing the thermal fuse. Most of my cooking failures were salvageable, though. It turns out that it's difficult to Completely Mess Things Up, so you should worry less and just go ahead and try it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chest freezers and bulk cooking make everything easier</b>
</p>

<p>
Cooking in bulk lets us minimize the number of left-over ingredients, especially if we adjust the recipes. Having meals in the freezer is an amazing way to reduce the risk of cooking experimental recipes: if it's an absolute failure, well, there's a guaranteed meal all ready to go. Freezing is also great for dealing with leftovers. If I don't feel like eating the same thing for the rest of the week, I can package it as individual lunches in the freezer for when I feel like having it again.
</p>

<h3>Next steps for me</h3>

<p>
There's plenty more to learn, and I look forward to getting even better at this over the next ten years. Here are some of the skills that would be fun to improve:
</p>

<p>
<b>Regular menu planning and a broader repertoire of recipes</b>
</p>

<p>
You know how some households run on predictable patterns? We do a little of this: soups and baking on the weekends because of time-of-use electricity charges; stir-fries to take advantage of fresh vegetables from our grocery shopping; maybe a vegetarian meal sometime during the week&#x2026; It would be good to get even better at planning what we're going to have, perhaps based on a two-week cycle of themes that's adjusted by what's on sale, and to introduce new recipes within that framework.
</p>

<p>
<b>Recycling leftovers into new dishes</b>
</p>

<p>
I tend to be pretty happy eating the same thing again and again (or freezing the leftovers if they've been around a while), but recycling left-overs into new dishes would extend their fridge-life and encourage people to eat them. There are books that focus on cascading one recipe into another, and it seems like a good skill to learn. It's also a quick way to get more variety out of the same cooking effort.
</p>

<p>
<b>Working with different spices and sauces</b>
</p>

<p>
We have a lot of spices in the cabinet. I should make an inventory of them and organize them for easy reach. Sauces are also good ways to give the same basic dish different tastes. If I learn more about flavour, I can stock the freezer and fridge with a wider range of tastes.
</p>

<p>
We'd been letting some vegetables and cooked food go to waste, so I've
been tinkering with how we prepare our meals in order to reduce
spoilage. Here's how we now cook in bulk.
</p>

<p>
<b>During the weekend, I prepare two types of dinners.</b> I usually pick
bulk recipes based on what's on sale at the supermarket. If there are
unused groceries from the previous week (sometimes I end up not
cooking things), I prepare a recipe that can use those up: curry,
okonomiyaki, soup, etc. I start a 10-cup pot of rice, too, since I'm
likely to use that up when packing individual meals and we go through
a lot of rice during the week.
</p>

<p>
<b>After the food is cooked, I put three-person portions into our large glass containers, setting aside four meals total (two of each type).</b>
That way, we have a little room to cook fresh dinners during the week
(which W- likes to do), but we also have some backups in case things
get busy. We alternate the prepared dinners for variety. For prepared
meals that are inefficient to portion out (ex: pasta sauce), I just
keep the entire pot in the fridge.
</p>

<p>
<b>The rest of the food is packaged in individual lunch-sized containers (at least 500g, including rice)</b> until the freezer is full
or the pots are empty. I label the containers using painter's tape and
a marker, writing down the initials of the recipe and a number for the
month. For example, chicken curry prepared in July is labeled CC7.
</p>

<p>
<b>If the freezer is full but there's still some food left, I pack the rest and refrigerate them.</b> If I still have rice
left, I might pack individual portions that I can add to the freezer
as we use up our supply. If I'm out of rice, I'll pack larger portions
that we can use for dinner or that I can split up into individual
portions later on.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we mix things up by having pizza or cooking lots of fresh
dinners during the week. <b>If there's still food in the fridge by the following weekend, I pack them up as frozen lunches.</b> There'll be space
in the freezer by then, and we're more likely to enjoy the variety if
it's spread out over the coming weeks. Freezing the leftovers means we
can avoid spoiling food out of procrastination.
</p>

<p>
<b>When it comes to the freezer, individual portions are much more convenient than larger portions.</b> You can take one to work and
microwave it for lunch. Sometimes I pack larger portions (ex: pizza,
pasta sauce), so we need to plan for that when defrosting them. If a
dinner portion is thawed in the fridge, it has to get eaten since it
can't be refrozen (unless we re-cook it, which we rarely do).
</p>

<p>
Our costs tend to be between $1.50 and $3 per portion. For example,
the Thai curry I made last time resulted in 20 portions out of $22.39
of groceries. Even if you count the spices and rice in our pantry, it
still comes to a pretty frugal (and yummy!) meal. Sure, there's labour
and electricity, but I enjoy cooking and we schedule it for the lower
rates of the weekend. Well worth it for us, and we're working on
getting even better at it.
</p>

<p>
Aside from reducing spoilage, I'm also working on increasing variety.
Getting the hang of spices will help me with that. I enjoyed making
curry from scratch, and am looking forward to exploring the different
curries of the world. We have a 5.3 cu.ft. Haier chest freezer
(fortunately not one of those affected by the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2013/Haier-America-Expands-Recall-of-Chest-Freezers/">recall</a>) and probably
won't be upgrading it until it conks out, since it's enough for us to
cook every two weeks or so. There's still room for improvement in
terms of freezer organization and getting through
ingredients/processed stuff, anyway. So much to learn! =)

<p>
Around this time each year, with the heat of summer sending the
lettuce to seed and sending us indoors, I usually fall out of love
with gardening. I don't feel like cooking, so the herbs go
unharvested. The lettuce, spinach, and other greens bolt, going bitter
and sending up more flowers than I can pinch off.
</p>

<p>
Having neglected to harvest as much as I could have, I tell myself I'll
just let them go to seed so that I can collect and replant those
seeds. But then the garden becomes dry, overgrown, and scraggly, and
slugs and other pests decimate the leaves. Only the tomatoes keep me
interested throughout the season. If I'm lucky, I remember the rest of
the garden in time to plant lettuce and peas for the fall.
</p>

<p>
This year, I'm trying something different. Seeds are inexpensive and
plentiful. Instead of waiting for my lettuce to go to seed, I'll
simply pull them up and start new plants. This keeps the garden
feeling more orderly, and gives me more sprouting to enjoy and look
forward to. Maybe I'll even walk to the florist at the corner and buy
more seedlings to take advantage of the warmth and sun. Maybe beets or
zucchini? I'm clearing a few squares at a time so that I can stagger
the planting and keep things manageable. Perhaps the rest of the
lettuce and the peas will have fully developed their seeds by the time
I get around to pulling them up. I think this will be better than
waiting for the whole box to finish. At least I'll always have
something on the go.
</p>

<p>
Someday, when I'm more of a gardener&#x2013;perhaps when I have heirloom
variants that are hard to find and easy to enjoy&#x2013;I'll look into
saving seeds again. In the meantime, I'm still working on developing
that summer-long habit of gardening, and I enjoy the exciting days of
sprouting.
</p>

<p>
Where else in my life am I letting things go to seed unnecessarily?
What else would benefit from pulling things up and starting fresh?
Sewing, perhaps. I have a lot of scraps and patterns I haven't looked
at or used. Writing, too - lots of snippets and outlines that I
haven't fleshed out. Sometimes it's good to clear things out and start
again (perhaps with a smaller goal, perhaps with more deliberate
attention). That way, the remnants of past decisions don't weigh down
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
How about your garden? How about your life?

Thanks for signing up! I'm looking forward to sharing the things I've learned and to learning from you along the way. There's a lot of stuff on my blog, but I thought I'd start with an introduction:
</p>

<p>
<b>Hi, I'm Sacha Chua, and I'm interested in lots of things.</b>
</p>

<p>
It's a little weird to not have one of those "I'm a &lt;job title goes here&gt;" introductions, but I'm starting to get used to it. I'm in the middle of a 5-year experiment with semi-retirement, which is really an excuse for me to learn more about entrepreneurship, consulting, writing, drawing, coding, and all those other things that were hard to squeeze into evenings and weekends back in my corporate life. (I had really liked working with a big company and an excellent team, but I wanted to learn these other things too.)
</p>

<p>
I started this blog when I was in university as a way of taking notes and sharing what I was learning. It turned out to be a great way to learn from other people too. I hope it will help you, and I'm looking forward to discovering what we can learn together.
</p>

<p>
<b>What can you expect from me?</b>
</p>

<p>
You'll get weekly blog updates with links to the posts I've read in the past week and some interesting things I learned about elsewhere on the Internet.
I post on my main blog daily, which can be a little overwhelming for people. But if you're an e-mail ninja or a feed reader fan, you can subscribe to the daily feed at <a href="http://feeds.sachachua.com/sachac">http://feeds.sachachua.com/sachac</a> .
</p>

<p>
Over the next few weeks, I'll also be sending you a few e-mails to help you find out about things you might like in my past posts. I might also write with the occasional question that I want to pick people's brains on before I write blog posts, maybe even with sneak previews of what I've been learning.

<p>
What a year! Life just keeps getting better and better.
</p>

<p>
I like looking forward by looking back: imagining myself in the future and seeing what changed.
<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/08/year-in-review-life-as-a-29-year-old/">Last August, I wrote</a>: "When I look back at this year on the eve of turning 31, I’d like to say&#x2026;"
So here's how all that worked out.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve learned and shared a lot. This next year will probably be a year
of intense learning in terms of life and work and Making Things
Happen. As tempting as it always is to go full speed ahead, I think
the result will be even better if I slow down and take notes along the
way.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I slowed down in terms of work, scaling back my consulting hours to
about two days a week and using the freed-up time for reading,
cooking, spending time with family, and working on other
projects/experiments like Emacs and sketchnoting. That worked out
really well.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve gotten very good at making decisions under lots of uncertainty.
The outcomes might not always be good, but at least the processes
will be well-reasoned and I’ll have notes to help me (and other
people) learn more.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm comfortable taking on bigger and bigger challenges. I'm
comfortable with research and can generally find some background
information quickly. I have fun sketching out different scenarios and
finding my way. This is working nicely too.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve expanded my freedom and abilities in this 5-year experiment.
I’ve focused on building up skills, knowledge, and relationships out
of curiosity (“What if?” “How can we make this better?”) instead of
fear (“Will I be able to hit the ground running if I decide to go
back to the workforce?”). I find creative ways to deal with
constraints, and those ideas help others. Writing, drawing, and
coding continue to be a large part of my life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I added a few useful business-related skills and improved a number of
my existing skills. Yay! This is definitely fun, and I'm looking
forward to figuring out what the next year will bring.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve gotten better at asking questions. This is tough, because I
tend to want to dig into things myself, Google+books+experiments
give me so much information, and advice can get a little weird if
you don’t take it. Maybe if I start asking people questions through
this blog, I might elicit interesting perspectives or encourage
people to teach something (especially if they don’t have blogs of
their own).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Philosophy turned out to be a good addition to the things I'm learning
and thinking about. By immersing myself in the conversations of book
authors throughout the ages, I can learn from all these very smart
people who have thought about things. =)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I live a simple and frugal life. Lifestyle inflation is the enemy.
If I can keep my wants and needs the same–-or even reduce them–-then
that helps us be even more free.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My base expenses were actually a little bit lower than they were the
previous year. Neat! The stock market has been doing pretty well
(aside from the current dip), and I've been saving most of the income
from consulting too. I'm going to figure out dividends next year, so
then I'll be able to move more money from savings into investments.
</p>

<p>
Where did the year go?

<p>
So, how am I different from the person I was last year?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>I'm healthier.</b> I like these new exercise habits (running to build
up endurance, the Hacker's Diet exercise ladder for very gradually
building up strength). We've been eating even better too.
</li>
<li><b>I did a lot of cool front-end work on my consulting engagement.</b> I
picked up new skill: Jive app/add-on development. Improved existing
skills, too: Javascript, analytics, etc.
</li>
<li><b>I spent a lot less time working, networking, and socializing</b>
(reduced by 263, 333, and 324 hours respectively!), and more time
working on Emacs, gardening, reading, and sleeping. I spent about as
much time writing as I did last year. I shifted most of my
socialization to Hacklab, since I like the way it fits me.
</li>
<li><b>I had good experiments with self-publishing.</b> I published my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/03/new-freepay-want-resource-sketchnotes-2013-also-emacs-dired-rocks/">2013
collection of sketchnotes</a>, <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/series/a-no-excuses-guide-to-blogging/#post-26790">a no-excuses guide to blogging</a> and <i>a
beginner's guide to learning Emacs Lisp</i>. I checked out Createspace
for making <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/sketchnotes2013book">a print version of my sketchnotes collection</a>, and that
actually worked out nicely. I did the Emacs Lisp guide as an e-mail
course, too.
</li>
<li><b>I drew more.</b> I thought I drew less, but actually, my time records
and my files say that I drew a <i>lot</i> more. It just didn't feel that
way because I've been writing so many text-based blog posts lately.
(Hah! Recency bias.)
</li>
<li><b>I learned more about podcasting</b> by doing short series of shows
with live sketchnotes, followed up with transcripts (Emacs Chats,
Helpers Help Out, Frugal Fire Show). I might not get into it
long-term, but it was interesting to try out.
</li>
<li><b>I'm more comfortable with talking to people and helping them
online.</b> I experimented with the Google Helpouts platform, helping
people learn more about note-taking, learning, building on introvert
strengths, and Emacs. That worked out well (tons of 5-star
reviews!), although I scaled my availability down so that I could
focus on other things.
</li>
<li><b>I'm more comfortable with philosophy</b>, and with the humanities in
general. I've been reading a lot lately, and I find philosophy to be
useful and interesting. I'm getting better at not worrying about
things and at writing about what I'm thinking. Yay!
</li>
<li><b>I'm more involved in family life.</b> I spend more time on
family-related things, and I've been helping W- more too.
</li>
<li><b>I've learned a little more about gardening.</b> Watering regularly
makes a difference, but I'm still constrained by environmental
factors.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next year, I'll turn 32. (Nice round number!) <b>When I do my annual review then, what would I like to be able to say about life as a 31-year-old?</b>
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>I have excellent health-related habits</b> I have the strength,
flexibility, and endurance to do what I want to do.
</li>
<li><b>Our home life is wonderful.</b> We enjoy yummy food, good projects, a
tidy house, simple lives, great relationships, and other things.
</li>
<li><b>I helped my consulting client make successful transitions.</b>
Upgrades, training, time away&#x2026; I did my work well, and they're in
a great position to continue doing awesome things in the future.
</li>
<li><b>I've broadened my business a little bit more.</b> I might go deeper
into writing/drawing/publishing, or I might look into product
development. This reduces the risk of being classified as a personal
services business, and it may lead to other interesting skills and
opportunities. In terms of development, I like web-based stuff more
than mobile, so maybe I'll focus on that.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Life is good. Looking forward to seeing how this year turns out!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-unnumbered-761">
<p>
Design seems like magic, but it's probably a skill that I can develop. If I just focus on coding, the things I build can end up looking like an accumulation of little ideas designed by committee. If I learn more about design and develop my own opinions, I can make recommendations that simplify the experience and make it more coherent. For example, on one of my consulting engagements, I could probably take the initiative in redesigning the help and support community for a better user experience. I have to work with the technical limitations of the platform, but as a coder, I have a little more latitude than most people do. By looking at how other people have structured their support experiences, maybe I can pick up ideas that I can try.

<b>I stuff as much as possible into my blog</b> - it seems to have the only
notes that last. I have a shelf full of half-used paper notebooks.
I've lost text files with notes on hard drives that have long since
vanished. I've encrypted messages to myself and, years later,
discovered I hadn't kept the key around. (Duh.) My blog has my most
long-lived notes, having survived several transfers between blog hosts
and a few backups. I've probably gotten the hang of this "blog backup
and migration" thing, and I trust it more than I trust third-party
services like Evernote.

<p>
The new <a href="http://hacklab.to/">Hacklab</a> (1266 Queen Street West) will have wood-working tools,
a skylight, and more space to set things up (maybe the sewing machine
and serger?). There's a big fabric store nearby, too. In addition to
those new capabilities, all the usual tools will probably be easier to
use: the laser cutter, the 3D printer, the CNC mill, the electronics
equipment&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, what would I like to learn more about so that I can
make the most of Hacklab? I've mostly been treating Hacklab as a place
to meet people, with the vegetarian cooking practice and social link
building as bonuses. There's a lot more I could do with it, though,
and it might be good to explore.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to become proficient in making things that fit our life. I
like how Norm made custom workbenches and corner tables from lumber. I
like how people 3D-print handles and adapters for various things, and
how they laser-cut cases, stencils, and jigs. I'm not entirely sure
how I'm going to handle transporting lumber and finished goods
(bicycle? cab? asking W- for a ride?), but maybe I can learn how to
draw up plans, verify those plans with people who have more
experience, and work on things at home (since we have many of the
tools anyway). So maybe I won't be making as much use of the tools,
but I can practise asking for help.
</p>

<p>
Although it would be pretty nice to make a better case for my Samsung
Galaxy S3 with the Hyperion extended battery I have&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
It might be good to use the skylight to start some plants during the
winter, too. I'll need to order seeds for that one, I think.
</p>

<p>
I could also work on web or Android stuff while I'm there, since those
are the sorts of things that other people work on. I could work on
writing too, but that's a little harder because of the background
conversations.
</p>

<p>
So a weekly or bi-weekly trip to Hacklab could be a commitment device
for making regular progress on a physical project (wood, sewing, or
electronic), a programming project, and vegan cooking adventures.
Would that be worth the ~$6 transit fare (+ about 1.5 hours of travel)
to get there in winter? Hmm. Probably. If I pre-commit the transit
fare so that I don't have to make lots of little decisions, carving
out a part for it from my budget for the year&#x2026; It makes sense to
push myself to go there, since if I stay home, I'm less likely to work
on those kinds of things.
</p>

<p>
We'll see how this works out!

Instant messaging and Internet Relay Chat feel natural for me,
possibly even more natural than conversation. I feel more fluent when
I write. In podcasts and real-life conversations, I often interrupt
myself, stutter, or use complex sentence patterns. When I write, I
feel like I'm thinking more clearly and saying things more clearly.
