<h1 class="title">Sharing Outline</h1>

<p>This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!
<a href="https://github.com/sachac/sharing">https://github.com/sachac/sharing</a>

<p>
Does a topic here intrigue you, or can you think of some useful
follow-ups ? E-mail me at <a href="mailto:sacha@sachachua.com">sacha@sachachua.com</a> (or
file an issue, if you're geeky that way ;) ).
</p>
<p>
Inspired by anything? Feel free to write your own posts, and send me a
link. =)

<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="todo DRAFTED">DRAFTED</span> How to get started with sketchnoting  :one-pager:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">

<p>Draw this
</p>
<ol>
<li>Take notes
</li>
<li>Why

</li>
<li>Take hand-written notes

</li>
<li>Slow down and write legibly
   You don't have to write everything
   Leave yourself space, then come back and fill things in later
   A good ink helps: find one that's readable and doesn't smear
   Tip: stash pens everywhere so that you're never without one!

</li>
<li>Emphasize important concepts
   Boxes, highlighter, color pencils, etc
   (Test the highlighter - sometimes ink can get messed up!)

</li>
<li>Use simple shapes.
   Star - important point
   Box, check - TODO
   Arrow - next step
   Speech bubble - quote
   Thought cloud - what you were thinking
   Lightbulb - idea

<p>   
   Make rough copies of diagrams
</p>
</li>
<li>Have fun by drawing faces. This is a surprisingly good way to
   remember an event, and it's also a good way to settle in if you're
   early. (Being early is great for grabbing good seats.)

<p>
   Write down the topic title and the speaker name, then spend a few
   minutes sketching the person's face. You can start with a simple
   rectangle with roughly the right proportions. Hair style? Glasses
   or eyes? Nose? Facial hair? Smile? Doesn't have to be perfect.
</p>
</li>
<li>Draw other icons. People often repeat themselves or say things you
   don't have to write down, so you can doodle during those parts.
   Draw simple images related to what people are talking about. (Or
   draw things that are completely unrelated - up to you!) Listen for
   visual metaphors and try to draw them. Leave yourself space, and
   then come back and doodle when you have time.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-1-27">Printing sketchnotes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-27">

<p>I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.
</p>
<p>
Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a
</p>
<p>
I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.
</p>
<p>
Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder&hellip;

How to listen and draw at the same time
</p>

<p>
When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!

Emacs newbie: Tips for learning keyboard shortcuts
</p>
<p>
The tutorial (C-h t) is useful and well worth going through several times. Getting used to marking a region with C-SPC versus using shift- takes some doing, but it’s really quite powerful once you get the hang of it – mainly because you can then use all sorts of navigational commands without getting RSI.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, you may want to look into mapping your Caps Lock to Control. Many people like the way it makes keyboard shortcuts easier to type.
</p>
<p>
I find it hard to remember keyboard shortucts too, so I use M-x a lot. M-x lets you call a command by its name. You can use C-h k to find out more about which function is called by a given keyboard shortcut, and then you can use M-x to call it by name if you don’t remember where it is. For example, if you don’t remember where split-window-vertically is bound, you can use M-x split-window-vertically.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, M-x where-is will tell you the keyboard shortcuts if you know a function name, and C-h f (describe-function) will give you more information if you give it a function name.
</p>
<p>
Writing-wise, Org Mode (<a href="http://www.orgmode.org">http://www.orgmode.org</a>) is totally awesome. I use it to write some of my more structured blog posts and web pages, and I also use it to keep this gigantic outline of things I’m planning to write about: <a href="http://sach.ac/outline">http://sach.ac/outline</a> . People have used it to write technical books and other lengthy documents. It’s also a fantastic planner for running your daily life. =)
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I want
to help make Emacs easier to learn!
</p>
<p>
Oh, another tip: use M-x icomplete-mode to turn on incremental completion, which will then show you hints when you start typing M-x [command-name]. You can use TAB to complete as far as you can, and then type in a few more characters to disambiguate. To turn this on by default whenever you start Emacs, add the following to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el (you might need to create this file):

<i>Michael Jones wanted to know how I organized my Org Mode files. Here's how I do things!</i>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode for Emacs</a> is an outliner that lets you add a little structure
to plain text files. Not only can you use it to move around, hide, and
show sections of your outline, but you can also:
</p><ul>
<li>schedule tasks and mark them as complete,
</li>
<li>add hyperlinks and formatting,
</li>
<li>estimate effort and track time,
</li>
<li>export to HTML and other formats,
</li>
<li>and even include code that you can run in-line.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I started with a single Org Mode file (appropriately called
organizer.org), but I've gradually fleshed this out into a number of
files. My goals for organizing my files this way are to be able to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish some files while keeping other files private,
</li>
<li>Add or remove groups of tasks from my agenda, or focus my
  agenda/search on the current file,
</li>
<li>Simplify processing my weekly review (categorizing
  accomplishments/tasks),
</li>
<li>Get a quick overview of important things, and
</li>
<li>Have file-specific options, like columns.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I often use <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs#agenda_commands">Org agenda custom commands</a> to jump around. For example,
one agenda command lists projects, and pressing RET on an agenda line
will take me to that project. I also use <code>org-capture</code> to take a note
from anywhere, and I use <code>org-goto</code> to navigate my files. For finding
specific files, I use <code>ido-find-file</code>. 
</p>
<p>
I use several Org Mode files. The five files below have a little more
than 1.3MB of text in total - tiny! - but they help me tremendously. I
also have lots of other Org files like my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs">Emacs configuration</a> and <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3968124/blog.html">my blog index</a> (I often use Org for publishing), but these are my main
files.
</p>
<p>
<b>Personal tasks and notes: organizer.org</b>
</p>
<p>
This is the catch-all for any tasks or notes that don't belong to the
files below. Here's the rough structure:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quick notes:</b> Tidbits that might not make it into their own blog
  posts, but which can be included in weekly reviews
</li>
<li><b>Reference:</b> Hours, license keys, etc.
</li>
<li><b>Open loops:</b> Anything I need to check on every so often
</li>
<li><b>Projects:</b> High-level things I'm focusing on
</li>
<li><b>Financial goals:</b> Things to save up for
</li>
<li><b>Someday/maybe:</b> Projects to do someday
</li>
<li><b>Weekly review:</b> Divided by year
</li>
<li><b>Monthly review:</b> More summaries
</li>
<li><b>Plans:</b> Personal plans
</li>
<li><b>2011, 2012, 2013&hellip;</b>: I use org-capture to quickly jot down notes.
  The datetree option automatically files them by day, which makes
  older ones easier to archive.
</li>
<li><b>Tasks:</b> A bucket for miscellaneous tasks
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Anything to do with business: business.org</b>
</p>
<p>
I organize these by the types of tasks I focus on and the notes I
want to keep.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn
<ul>
<li>Clients
</li>
<li>Leads
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Build
<ul>
<li>Projects

</ul>

</li>
<li>Reference
</li>
<li>Tasks
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>people.org</b>
</p>
<p>
I organize these by relationships so that I can remember who's out
there.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Family
</li>
<li>Extended family
</li>
<li>Canada friends
</li>
<li>Hacklab

</li>
<li>Family friends
</li>
<li>Other tasks
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>routines.org</b>
</p>
<p>
I organize these by frequency and omit the tasks from my weekly
review. This also contains my "In case of&hellip;" scenarios and my backup
documentation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Every day
</li>
<li>Once a week
</li>
<li>Once a month
</li>
<li>Once a quarter

<li>Once a year

</li>
</ul>


<p>
*<a href="http://sach.ac/outline">sharing/index.org</a>*
</p>
<p>
I organize this by topic. See <a href="http://sach.ac/outline">http://sach.ac/outline</a> for the
published version!
</p>
<p>
<b>decisions.org</b>
</p>
<p>
I organize these by status. I also use org-choose markers (ex:
CHOSEN, MAYBE) inside the categories, but the headings make it easier
to review.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pending
</li>
<li>Current

I would love to be able to write all of my blog posts within Emacs. I like the outline tools and simple markup of <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a>. Org Mode and org2blog are invaluable when I'm writing a post with lots of code or keyboard commands, because it's easy to set up syntax highlighting or add teletype text. <a href="http://www.pablumfication.co.uk/2012/01/15/blog-posting-with-emacs-using-org2blog/">Here's an interesting self-referential example of org2blog's power</a> - using <code>#INCLUDE</code> to include the Org blog post source in the post itself.
</p>
<p>
If I expect that a post will have lots of images, I tend to use Windows Live Writer because it takes care of resizing and aligning images, linking to the original size. Because it uses my blog's stylesheet, I can get a sense of how the text will flow around it. I can quickly draw an idea in Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, copy and paste it into Windows Live Writer, and then resize it until it feels balanced on the page. Sometimes I draft a post in Emacs and then open it in Windows Live Writer or ScribeFire so that I can add images. 
</p>
<p>
Org Mode also supports images, but it's not as easy to resize things there. If I wrote a function that used ImageMagick to save the clipboard image to a file, resize it to the appropriate dimensions, and link it to the full-size image, maybe that would do the trick. Still, that sounds like it would be a fair bit of work. Maybe someday. Hmm - any chance someone reading this blog happens to already have that snippet handy? =)

Here's my evolving break-down of blogging-related skills, including
notes for future blog posts. I'm currently working on getting better
at <b>outlining</b> (from high-level down to chunks of ~100 words)
and <b>synthesizing</b> (especially combining other people's insights with
my experiences). I'm using this outline to think of ways to
deliberately practise certain aspects of blogging, to plan posts that
will help people learn, and to clarify what I would like to delegate
to assistants or work with coaches for.

<ul>
<li>What happens if I spend four or more hours on a blog post? :TODO:
</li>
<li>New superpower - I can take more time to do things than I used to.
<ul>
<li>Cooking. Reading.
</li>
<li>And it pays off.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Also why: too much
</li>
<li>Spending <i>more</i> time on each blog post
<ul>
<li>Why? It's not just a blog post, it's the learning
</li>
<li>No time pressures anyway
<ul>
<li>I've written far enough ahead that I'm not worried about running out of posts any time soon
</li>
<li>I'm surrounded by ideas
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>I don't want to write a massive, useful, linkbait post that disappears from my brain after I write it. Like cramming for a school exam and then moving on.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>What can I improve?
<ul>
<li>Filter through lots more material
</li>
<li>Link to more resources; compare
</li>
<li>Touch a post more often
<ul>
<li>Spread it out over several days

<li><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/weekly-content-plan/">http://www.copyblogger.com/weekly-content-plan/</a>

</ul>

</li>
<li>Let your subconscious work on it
</li>
<li>Look at it with fresh(er) eyes
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Write longer posts?
<ul>
<li>900~2,000 words works well; doesn't feel too long
</li>
<li>Write longer, then cut/restructure/spread out over time?
</li>
<li>Go to 3,000 words? <a href="http://blog.osmosio.com/writing-a-blog-post/">http://blog.osmosio.com/writing-a-blog-post/</a>

<h3 id="sec-3-7"><span class="todo OUTLINED">OUTLINED</span> Think about your blogging goals and how your posts align with them &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="tag"><span class="data">data</span></span></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-7">


<p>
I've been thinking about my goals for blogging because I want to get better. I write almost every day, fueled by habits of reading and experimenting. I have time to learn things, and I can learn more effectively if I learn deliberately. Here's what I'm learning about being clear about your goals and analyzing how your actions match up with them.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-7-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-7-1">1. Clarify your goals</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-7-1">


<p>
It's good to know what your goals are and how the different approaches serve those goals so that you can choose the ones that are the most effective. You can also look at each approach to see how you can improve it.
</p>
<p>
After some reflection, I came up with this list of goals for my blog:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn more effectively by thinking through complexity or explaining what I'm learning
</li>
<li>Explore assumptions and possibilities; become more aware of them myself, and help other people see them
</li>
<li>Improve core skills through practice: making decisions, explaining ideas, organizing thoughts, etc.
</li>
<li>Save myself and other people time spent re-solving the same problems or learning the same things
</li>
<li>Build a long-term archive that I can use to remember what I'm learning and see differences over time
</li>
<li>Learn from other people through questions, comments, and conversations
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Your list of goals will probably look different. Many people have goals such as building a business by promoting their products or services, educating clients or readers, keeping family members up to date, working through difficult issues by writing anonymously, and so on. Take a moment to think about and prioritize your goals.
</p>
<p>
If you're having problems expressing your goals, you can also take a look at your recent blog posts and ask yourself, "Why did I write this?" What results did you want to get? What purpose did it serve? One blog post might work towards several different goals.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-7-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-7-2">2. Analyze the ways you approach those goals</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-7-2">


<p>
Different actions support different goals to different extents. Think about the different types of blog posts you write. Score them against each of your goals on a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 5 means that type of post helps a specific goal a lot, while 1 means it does very little or even nothing for that particular goal.
</p>
<p>
Here are some of the types of posts I share and how they line up with the goals I listed above:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Sorting the table by the total score makes it easy to see which approaches you value more. If some goals are much more important to you than others, you can also weight those goals in your calculations. For example, if building a long-term archive was twice as important to me, I could double that column when calculating the total score. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this ranking makes it clearer why I feel good about original drawings and sketchnotes, and why I skew towards decision reviews and "thinking through things"-type posts even if they don't feel focused enough on saving other people time. Most of the blogging advice tends to focus on writing tips, but they don't motivate me as much. 
</p>
<p>
How about you? Do your post types match up with your goals? Are there clear winners that you should focus on? You can write lower-value posts from time to time because they address different needs. For example, I post weekly reviews because they're useful to me even if they're less useful for others.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-7-3">


<p>
Of course, since these values are subjective, it helps to adjust them based on your website analytics or feedback from your readers. For example, if you think a type of post saves people a lot of time, you'll probably see a lot of visits or comments on it. If you have Google Analytics, you can export the <b>Content - Site Content - All Pages</b> table to a spreadsheet, classify the top X links, and then see what types of posts people spend their time on. For example, I analyzed the top 500 pages visited in July 2013, classified each by type, calculated average views and time per page, and sorted it by average views to get a sense of which posts tend to be more popular.

<p>
My sketchnotes are more popular by far. My technical notes are surprisingly durable over time, even though you'd expect them to be superseded by bugfixes, technical changes, better documentation, and so on. Posts as old as 2004 still turn up. Because people still get a lot of value from my old tech posts, I adjusted the "Save time" rating for tech tips from my original value of 3 to 4. (I had started with a lower value because I figured that not a lot of people would probably have run into the same issues I did, but it turns out that time makes up for audience size and the long tail works.) As I expected, tips that few other people have written about get more pageviews than tips that more people have written about, although I'm surprised that people tend to spend more time on the common tips. My "thinking out loud" posts are more popular than I expected. (Limitations: This only looks at single-page views in a single month.) Also, people tend to click on my weekly reviews if I add a brief description to the title, so that's something.
</p>
<p>
Anecdotally speaking, I get a lot of comments and links to my sketchnotes. I'm also delighted by the conversations that occasionally grow out of the "thinking out loud" posts, and how sometimes people will share even better solutions when I post my technical notes.

<h4 id="sec-3-7-4">4. Identify ways to improve each approach</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-7-4">


<p>
Now that you've looked at what makes each type of post different, you can focus on how to improve each type by building on its strengths or compensating for its weaknesses. Here's what I'm planning for the kinds of posts I write:
</p>
<p>
<b>Draw original stuff</b>: It takes me 2-4 hours to make one of these. I like making technical notes (ex: Emacs), sketchnote tutorials (to help people draw more), and other drawings related to life and planning. I'm getting used to drawing them with less up-front planning. Even though I end up moving things around, I think it's useful to just get started. Drawing involves a trade-off because images are not as searchable as text. I can fix that by including the text, but it's a little awkward and it takes more time. Still, people like the drawings a lot, and I like them too.
</p>
<p>
<b>Draw book reviews and events:</b> I go to fewer events these days, but I'm reading a lot more books. It takes me two hours to read a typical business book in depth, drawing notes along the way. I tend to draw book reviews only when I've already gotten a sense that a book is worth reading in depth. One way to increase my frequency is to draw book notes based on the skimmed parts of books that I'm not reading deeply - perhaps breaking out just the chapter or idea that resonates with me, and using that to illustrate a blog post reflecting on it. I can also work on getting more high-quality books into my pipeline, or practise by drawing more books with fewer value judgments.
</p>
<p>
<b>Think out loud:</b> I can improve the "Save time" score by stashing the notes in my outline, adding observations, until I've fleshed it out enough for preliminary findings and advice. It means that the output will be more concise in its reasoning and I'll have to do more learning on my own instead of opening up the conversation early, but then the posts will be useful for other people as well as for me. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> is a good example of a blog that mixes personal stories and useful observations. The main thing that was holding me back from doing this before was losing track of my drafts, but my outline is a good step.
</p>
<p>
For example, this post started as a rough outline, thinking out loud about what kinds of posts I wanted to write. Now I'm going back and filling it in with other information that might be useful for people. If it ends up too long, I might have to trim it. We'll get there!
</p>
<p>
<b>Share tech tips, troubleshooting notes, or code:</b> The limiting factor here is that I'm not working on any professional projects that I can write about, so I'm forced to run into and resolve fewer issues. I can replace that with working on my own projects or on open source projects, or helping people with questions. I often tweak or work on things related to Emacs, Wordpress, or data visualization, so there's that. If I set aside time and find a good source of small bugs so that I can ease my way into a habit of contributing to open source again, then that will also help me with my life goal to keep my technical skills sharp.
</p>
<p>
<b>Review longer spans of time:</b> I can increase the frequency of decision reviews by scheduling them so that I don't lose track of items. Because I manage my outline in Org Mode, that should be relatively easy to do. I can also bootstrap this by reviewing last year and last decade's monthly reviews (if available), or the blog posts if not. I have an advantage here because I have a lot of public notes over the years.
</p>
<p>
<b>Write tips that few other people can cover:</b> There are lots of information gaps to fill. Sometimes it's because people don't have the time, inclination, or confidence to write about something. Sometimes it's because I have a useful combination of skills or I can bring a different perspective. If I can't find information, that's a good reason to write it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Write tips that other people can also cover:</b> The world doesn't really need another "how to find the time to blog" tutorial. If I can filter through search results for a good one and make it more findable, that beats writing one from scratch&ndash;unless I can add something special or relate different types of advice to each other.
</p>
<p>
<b>Review recent posts (weekly, monthly):</b> These are low-value in the short term (mostly lists of links, plus the nudge to do my weekly planning process), but I've found them to be surprisingly useful over the years. They also help keep my large blog archive manageable. That's why I keep posting them. I've started using the weekly and monthly reviews to give people <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/how-i-use-feedburner-to-give-people-the-option-of-different-blog-update-frequencies/">less-frequent subscription options</a> (daily can be a little overwhelming), so that's helpful too.

<p>
"Get better" is a vague goal. If you can identify the specific goals you would like to work toward, different ways to move towards those goals, and specific actions you can take to improve those approaches, you'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of growing. You'll find it easier to recognize or create opportunities to grow, and you can track your progress along the way. You might also be able to identify counter-productive approaches and replace them with ones that move towards more of your goals. Good luck and have fun!

<p>
There's a strong correlation (0.84) between the number of visits and the number of comments, which makes sense. There is, however, practically no correlation between the percentage of posts I write for other people and how many posts or visits I get. My Feedburner stats show that my other-focused tend to get clicked on more, although some of my reflective posts are also popular.
Anecdotally, I see my other-focused posts shared on Twitter more often, which makes sense too.
</p>
<p>
Google Analytics lets me look at stats for individual pages, so I
analyzed the stats for July. This doesn't count the times when people
read the entirety of the post on the homepage, just when they view the
individual post by clicking on the link. I looked at the top 100 pages
in terms of number of visits. I classified 70 of those as
"other-focused" and 12 of those as "self-focused". The top
self-focused posts got an average of 143 views per page, while the top
other-focused posts got an average of 233 posts per page. People also
spent an average of 1.7 minutes longer on those pages (5 minutes vs
3.3 minutes).
</p>



<pre class="src src-sql">SELECT DATE_FORMAT(post_date, <span class="org-string">'%Y-%m'</span>) AS month, COUNT(id), SUM(comment_count) FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type=<span class="org-string">'post'</span> AND post_status=<span class="org-string">'publish'</span> GROUP BY month;
</pre>


<p>
What makes good posts like that?
</p><ul>
<li>The posts that spread widely tend to be the ones that are visual: the Shy Connector, a Teacher's Guide to Web 2.0 at School, How to Learn Emacs, sketchnotes, sketchnoting tips, and visual book reviews.
</li>
<li>The posts that are surprisingly popular over a long period of time are my technical notes: Emacs, Drupal, Rails, Lotus Notes, and so on. You'd expect them to be superseded by better documentation or changing technology (and sometimes they are), but they tend to endure.
</li>
<li>Sometimes my personal thinking-through-stuff posts unexpectedly resonate with people, and people share their comments and insights. (Ex: <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/03/passion-and-uncertainty/">Passion and uncertainty</a>)
</li>
<li>I don't have to write advice posts from a position of authority ("You should do this, you should do that") in order to be useful. I can create value by:
<ul>
<li>Describing what's out there (sketchnotes, visual book reviews)
</li>
<li>Sharing my technical troubleshooting notes, work-arounds, hacks, or discoveries from reading documentation/code
</li>
<li>Applying advice to my life and sharing my experiences
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>What would success look and feel like?
<ul>
<li>I'm going to be selfish about this because I can. =)
<ul>
<li>Is it okay to say that I blog more for myself? Because I do. Although your comments, shares, and links are nice. I feel like I should say that I write for readers. Attention is a gift. Many people would say that attention is valuable, and then turn around and try to sell you something.
</li>
<li>Someday, perhaps, when I have something I want to tell people, and I acquire a Voice of Advice, then I'll write more for other people.
<ul>
<li>When would I feel good about that?
</li>
<li>Is there something I feel good about?
<ul>
<li>I feel comfortable giving people advice on learning, reading, making better decisions, trying things out, and sharing.
</li>
<li>I feel comfortable helping people learn more about Emacs, Wordpress, and a little Excel.
</li>
<li>I feel comfortable that drawing is another way to create value.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>In the meantime
<ul>
<li>If I want to invest more time in writing&hellip;
<ul>
<li>I would write about things that few people write about
<ul>
<li>Emacs? Visual thinking? What it's like to make blogging such a part of your learning?
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Drawing, right&hellip; Although Sketchnote Army does pretty well.
</li>
<li>Something else.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>False dilemma. (Trilemma?) I know. The choice isn't really between these options, and I don't have to make one choice. I can write about all these things in the course of a week. But I wanted to figure out, if I wasn't keen on the first two options, what <i>am</i> I leaning towards, so I can intentionally work on it?
</li>

<li>A post that makes me a better person

<li>Better at learning and sharing

<li>Better at resilience and positivity

<ul>
<li>Blog posts that represent larger chunks of growing (going from 0.01% to 0.1%)?
          Improving by 0.01% every day means getting 4% better in a year, if you're fine with simplified math. Improving by 0.1% every day means getting 44% better in a year.
</li>
<li>One way to do this is to write less, to sit on posts longer until they develop, to start with a hundred ideas and tweak them for days or weeks (or longer!) until they're deep and insightful and useful.
<ul>
<li>Write less? No, I like writing almost every day, and I forget if I don't write things down. &ndash;verbose Stuff gets lost in my private notes. Here we might have conversations.
<ul>
<li>Arguing against myself: reasons for posting earlier rather than later
<ul>
<li>Learn from the conversation
</li>
<li>Get feedback
<ul>
<li>Is it something unusual worth digging into?
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Flesh things out on demand (in response to people's questions, etc.)
</li>
<li>Get good value from time (diminishing returns?) - 80%
</li>
<li>Throw more pots
<ul>
<li>Deliberate practice, engagement
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Another way to get a feel for what these deeper posts would be like would be to summarize experiences and update them with lessons learned
<ul>
<li>For example, things I've learned in the past ten years, like cooking.
</li>
<li>This will give me a feel for what deeper posts might feel like.
</li>
<li>Then I can play with timeframes
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>It would be worth getting the hang of this for new ideas, though.
</li>
<li>So I need to get better at getting better.
</li>
<li>Well, maybe an order of magnitude is ambitious. (0.01% to 0.1% is 10 times!) What would "a little better" look like?
</li>
<li>Grow more
<ul>
<li>Ask better questions
<ul>
<li>Know what "better" looks like and what direction it's in
</li>
<li>Ask the questions behind the questions
</li>
<li>Ask <i>different</i> questions
</li>
<li>See and question assumptions
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Research
<ul>
<li>Books, blog posts, other resources
</li>
<li>Reaching out to people (!)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Observe
<ul>
<li>Notice
</li>
<li>Describe
</li>
<li>Be less worried
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Try things out
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>All that considered, I still want to write in small increments
<ul>
<li>Behind the scenes
<ul>
<li>It's like the way I take sketchnotes. I try to capture as much as I can instead of summarizing it, because you can summarize based on your notes but it's hard to go the other way around.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>I love being able to link to posts from years ago when I was still figuring something out
</li>
<li>There are plenty of people who'll share advice &ndash; the results of their experiences &ndash; without sharing (or remembering!) much of the journey along the way.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>So what's next for me then?
<ul>
<li>Getting better at getting better
</li>
<li>Letting outlines steep
<ul>
<li>I think I like leaving outlines hanging - it gives me something to focus on while doing the dishes or other chores
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>But not too navel-gazey
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Something I want to remember
</li>
<li>&hellip; but not too much pressure here, mind you, or I'll probably be unable to write <i>anything</i>. So it doesn't have to Measurably Improve the Human Condition.
</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-9">

<p>Lower-priority: I can wait until it seems more likely that my balance will change, or I can transform this into a post about blog role models and getting closer 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Good balance
</li>
<li>What kind of balance do I want to have?
</li>
<li>I'm thinking about this because this balance might change
</li>
<li>As an introvert, I don't want to impose on other people
<ul>
<li>I'm somewhat okay with blog reading being completely voluntary
</li>
<li>This is why I haven't gotten around to e-mail newsletters yet, even though reading is voluntary too.
</li>
<li>Maybe I don't have to? 
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>I want most of my posts to be <b>useful.</b>
</li>
<li>I don't want to be generic. What's the point of writing something you could just find on Lifehacker? So I tell stories about what I'm learning.
</li>
<li>What I want to avoid:
<ul>
<li>Article mills
</li>
<li>Me-me-me-blah-blah-blah
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>But there are good examples
<ul>
<li>Lifehacker tends to be impersonal
</li>
<li>The Simple Dollar is a little closer to the impersonal side of things, but is sprinkled with personal stories
</li>
<li>Penelope Trunk and Mel Chua write more personally than I do
<ul>
<li>What makes their blogs feel more personal?
<ul>
<li>Penelope Trunk writes about more stresses and difficulties. 
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Mel's writing communicates her excitement and passion
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Mr. Money Mustache is a great mix of useful + personal.
<ul>
<li>I think, of all the blogs I read, I like his the most.

<li>Why I like Mr. Money Mustache's blog
<ul>
<li>Excellent balance of useful and personal
</li>
<li>topic is interesting as well, of course
</li>
<li>frugality - not just pinching pennies or juggling finances, but living well 
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>What are some of the things that Mr. Money Mustache does differently?
<ul>
<li>Writing
<ul>
<li>The alias is nifty and amusing. 
</li>
<li>He's more frank about finance (naturally).
</li>
<li>He's great at poking fun at himself. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/07/10/if-i-woke-up-broke/">more</a> 
</li>
<li>He uses stronger language, including more intense adjectives and some swearing. He also uses a wider vocabulary and more wordplay. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/04/29/frequently-complained-questions/">more</a> I should totally give myself permission to use less common words. =)
</li>
<li>He uses more stats, calculations, and case studies. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/">more</a>
</li>
<li>He's more confident about giving advice. 
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Formatting
<ul>
<li>He doesn't always emphasize the key points in his paragraphs, but they're readable anyway.
</li>
<li>His posts tend to be longer.
</li>
<li>He uses shorter paragraphs.
</li>
<li>His tables are formatted more prettily. Hey, sometimes it's the small stuff&hellip; =)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Organization
<ul>
<li>He's focused on financial blogging and the frugal lifestyle, while I blog about whatever I'm interested in.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>He gets a lot of input from readers
<ul>
<li>People share their situations and give each other advice
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Layout
<ul>
<li>His front page uses a summary layout with larger visuals.
</li>
<li>He has large graphical ads in the sidebar.
</li>
<li>He uses a serif font and a visually divided background
</li>
<li>His links are underlined in the post body, although not elsewhere.
</li>
<li>Links open in a new window. (Hmm, I've got mixed feelings about that&hellip;)
</li>
<li>He has a large post footer which has a blog, a new reader welcome, a random link, subscription/social media instructions, a community forum, and a subscription form, previous/next links with titles, and <i>then</i> comments, trackbacks, and the comment form.
</li>
<li>He has a large page footer with a blog roll, popular posts, stats, selected categories, and tags.
</li>
<li>He has a "Start Here" and a menu item for various how-tos.
</li>
<li>He has a recommendations page with links to posts.

<li>I took a month off from my two-days-a-week consulting gig so that I

<p>
The advice these days is to include a large image in your blog post,
somewhere “above the fold”, so that it can attract attention, visually
break up the page, and make your blog post more interesting.
</p>
<p>
I’m still trying to get the hang of how this might work. Other blogs
do this pretty well – Lifehacker, for example. More often, though,
stock photos look fake. Too posed. Too perfect. I could never quite
get the hang of
</p>

<p>
Hypothesis:
</p><ul>
<li>I can get better at visually communicating if I learn how to use
  stock photos effectively.
</li>
<li>What does it mean to effectively use stock photos?

It took me a couple of hours, but I finally cleared the 700+ items
that had piled up in my Evernote inbox. Every so often, I go on a
tagging and filing spree. I was thinking about this because Timothy
Kenny told me how he has a virtual assistant file the notes in his
Microsoft OneNote notebooks.
</p>
<p>
Is my filing really worth it? Is it something I value enough to pay
someone else to do? Could I explain what I wanted clearly enough so
that other people could do it? Could I benefit from organization even
if I'm not the one organizing things myself?
</p>
<p>
Before I dig into that, I should probably examine this question: <b>What do I use Evernote for, and what could "better" look like?</b>
</p>
<p>
Here's a quick summary of the different reasons I use Evernote:

<p>
I have different types of clipping activities:
</p><ul>
<li><b>A. Researching a topic</b>, which results in lots of clips related to a
  single topic. Usually in preparation for a blog post or as a way to
  answer a question.
</li>
<li><b>B. Casual browsing and clipping</b> based on blog posts, news items, or
  other things I come across; roughly topical (ex: skill
  development), although may be tagged and filed in different places
</li>
<li><b>C. Saving reference material from email or websites</b>, which should be filed
</li>
<li><b>D. Adding notes on the go using my phone</b>, which should be reviewed
  and acted on or filed when I get back to my computer
</li>
<li><b>E. Automatically clipping things based on external input</b>, using
  services like IFTTT to archive my blog posts.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
There are several strategies I could use to manage my Evernote
collection. I can choose different strategies based on the results
that I want. Here are some possibilities:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A. Spend a few extra seconds tagging and filing things when I clip   them.</b> Advantage: I touch something once, so I don't have to recall
  the context of an item.
</li>
<li><b>B. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file shortly after   clipping.</b> Advantages: I can select multiple entries and tag them
  give them the same tags, and copy all the note links in one go.
</li>
<li><b>C. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file weekly.</b> This is my
  current strategy. This isn't working out too well - things pile up.
</li>
<li><b>D. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then teach someone to file.</b>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
I think strategy B will give me a good improvement in performance
without me needing to bring in someone else.
</p>
<p>
One of the areas that I could generally improve in is integrating the
notes into my outlines and plans. Instead of just collecting the
information, maybe I can use Copy Note Link and then spend some time
adding those links to my outline. Alternatively, I can copy the
source URL right then and there, find where it fits into my outline,
and paste the link. If org2blog respects comments, I could even use
that as part of my workflow.
</p>
<p>
So if I were to outsource more tasks in order to improve my
effectiveness at learning, I think I'd gain more value from finding
someone who can speed-read like I do, filtering through lots of cruft
on the Internet to find high-quality resources. They could then clip
those pages into Evernote for my review. That might be worth an
experiment or two&hellip; Let's find out how that works!

Sketching a 1-hour talk generally takes 2-4 hours, including time to get there and a schedule that usually includes networking.

Shorter talks tend to be lighter-weight unless they've been rigorously planned and rehearsed.

<li>conversation with Timothy Kenny, who has just started experimenting with daily e-mail newsletters

</li>
<li>I've been thinking about e-mail newsletters because Timothy Kenny
  has just started with his.
</li>
<li>Typical advice for growing and (dare I say it?) monetizing your
  blog.
<ul>
<li>Offer an incentive for people to sign up for your mailing list.
<ul>
<li>PDF
</li>
<li>exclusive content
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Put people on an autoresponder.
</li>
<li>Mail people regularly to build the relationship
<ul>
<li>Sell them stuff later on
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>I don't even send friends or family e-mail normally
<ul>
<li>Hmm, maybe I'm not used to the grammar of it?
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>also, it takes me an average of 6 minutes to reply to an e-mail. 
<ul>
<li>Oddly,
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>RSS is mostly dead. Only geeky people use it. <a href="#sec-3-28">outline</a>
</li>
<li>Automatic e-mail newsletters
</li>
<li>I want to sell things only if they save you a lot of time
</li>
<li>Forget that. I want to give away so much that you almost feel
  obliged to help.
<ul>
<li>and since I don't need that much money for my lifestyle (I think)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>I'm very good at planning inexpensive experiments. Besides, that
  makes it easier for other people to replicate.
</li>
</ul>



<p>
Why: because there are people who send e-mail, but don't blog
</p>
<ul>
<li>why don't they blog?
<ul>
<li>self-conscious: only the "best content" out there

<h3 id="sec-3-27">Thoughts on growing an audience</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-27">

<ul>
<li>Sometimes I wonder if I should do more of the "Right Things" when
  it comes to building a blog.
<ul>
<li>Focus on one or two topics so that people will subscribe because
      you're consistent and reliable.
</li>
<li>Research keywords so that you can optimize for search engines
      queries and write content that will bring people in.
</li>
<li>Reach out to new audiences with guest posts.
</li>
<li>Send e-mail newsletters so that you can build relationships and
      so that you can sell to people later on.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Why
<ul>
<li>Can save other people time
</li>
<li>Can learn from more people
</li>
<li>Scale up - create more value for each unit of time I invest
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Sometimes I'm envious of blogs with hundreds of comments. On sites
  like that, people learn a lot from each other, not just me. But I
  remember that reading and responding to comments takes time, and I'd
  want to filter through them for spam, and that other people glaze
  over when they see pages and pages of comments and end up not
  reading them. It's okay. I like the in-depth conversations we have
  in comments. I'm not entirely sure if I'm sour-graping, but it seems
  to make sense.
</li>
<li>Sometimes I wonder if this should be more like other blogs. But then
  that's a well-travelled path, with lots of other people exploring
  it. I have this amazing opportunity to try something different. I
  should.
</li>
<li>Actually, I already know what I should do&ndash;what works for me, what
  I should do more.
<ul>
<li>The enduring posts on my blog are either tech notes (Emacs,
      Drupal) or sketches.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>The clearer my "no", the less I'm distracted from the things that I
  can do.
</li>
<li>Like the way I hack around my introversion
<ul>
<li>Write about whatever I'm learning about - variety of interests, and
      let more focused people use search results and category links
</li>
<li>Look at other people's questions and failed search results to
      nudge me to write about certain topics if I'm curious about them
      too
</li>
<li>Read good blogs and write about what inspires me, linking.
      Invite people who don't have blogs to share their tips and
      lessons learned on mine.
</li>
<li>Build relationships through comments. Give away as much as I
      can of what I know. Let people show their appreciation if they
      want to. Money is nice, but there are other ways too.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Risks in getting too big
<ul>
<li>Internet has a seamy underside
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Introvert
</li>
<li>The time I would spend in pitching guest posts, etc.
<ul>
<li>versus making things

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Drawing
<ul>
<li>Nearly 39,000 people visited in May, when I published
</li>
<li>Plenty of blogs
</li>
<li>Lots of infographics
</li>
<li>Not that many useful, non-marketing drawings
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>It's okay

</li>
<li>Are there low-effort, high-benefit things I can do to make this better?

<ul>
<li>Might get to the point where people are learning from each other
<ul>
<li>You can do this elsewhere on the Internet
</li>
<li>So it would have to be a particularly interesting
          combination of people

<h4 id="sec-4-5-1">Session 1: The Whys and Hows of Tracking Time</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-1">

<p>Discuss objectives and motivations for tracking time. Plan possible questions you want to ask of the data (which influences which tools to try and how to collect data). Recommend a set of tools based on people’s interests and context (paper? iPhone? Android? Google Calendar?).
Resources: Presentations on time-tracking, recommendations for tools, more detail on structuring data (categories, fields); possible e-mail campaign for reminders
Output: Planning worksheet for participants to help people remember their motivations and structure their data collection; habit triggers for focused, small-scale data collection, buddying up for people who prefer social accountability

<p>Checking in to see if people are tracking time the way they want to. Online and/or one-on-one check-ins before the workshop date, plus a group session on identifying and dealing with obstacles (because it helps to know that other people struggle and overcome these things). Preliminary analysis of small-scale data.
Resources: Frequently-encountered challenges and how to deal with them; resources on habit design; tool alternatives
Output: Things to try in order to support habit change; larger-scale data collection for people who are doing well

<p>I've used Microsoft Excel's <code>SUMIF</code> function to conditionally add up
values before. For example, <code>SUMIF</code> is handy when you have a table of
use cases and you want to sum the points for all the use cases with
priority 1. <code>SUMIFS</code> (Microsoft Excel 2007 and later) is even more
powerful - it allows you to specify multiple criteria.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-18">

<p>Imagine I have amazing assistants and a smoothly-running team. What am I doing with those capabilities?
</p>
<p>
2 days a week, I'm focused on talking to people. I'm booked efficiently; tea, lunch, tea, second tea. Some of these meetings involve walks instead of food. The meetings cluster in various locations in order to minimize travel time. I might have one day for face-to-face meetings and one day for virtual meetings.
</p>
<p>
After each meeting, I have at least half an hour to define next actions and get the ball rolling. It's easy to prioritize based on time and importance. We get the first actions out right away, impressing people, and then we follow up with depth. My assistant fills in the time with other tasks from the next actions list. I have at least 20 hours of work for people, so it's easy for them to focus.
</p>
<p>
Types of things I delegate:
Scheduling - I forward them emails and get back neatly formatted calendar entries
Email response handling - they read my mail, prioritize, send me action items, and work on tasks.
Web research - I send them questions and get back summaries of the top ten resources I should read. I suggest search queries, and they add their own.
Illustration - I have backup illustrators who can sketchnote things that I can't get to, or who can share different styles and metaphors.
Development - When I have an idea about Rails or Wordpress, I can work with someone to make it happen.
Web design - themes, tweaks, beautifully HTMLized pages&hellip;
Copywriting and copyediting - I send things over and get polished, engaging content
Calls - Assistants can take care of calling businesses when they're open and following up if needed, such as when setting appointments or making reservations.
Layout - I share a Dropbox folder with a bunch of graphics or documents. The assistant lays things out so that they're well-balanced in terms of whitespace and size.
Transcription - I save webinars and interviews (or set people up to record) into a Dropbox shared folder, and I send an email. I get a well-formatted blog post or document with the cleaned-up transcript.
Outlining and writing - someone helps me brainstorm blog post topics and outlines, fleshing them out with research, and organizing the topics into books
Video - editing, synchronizing sound, adding transitions, etc.
&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I also have recurring tasks for projects and initiatives I care about. Things just work smoothly. I get confirmations.
</p>
<p>
I have this lovely web-based process manual and a visual overview of tasks.
</p>
<p>
I'm always collecting people for my pipeline.
Hiring is not stressful - I have good onboarding and offboarding
processes. I hire shortly before I really need to, so that I can ramp
up people.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">


<p>
Goal: Learn, share, scale
</p><ul>
<li>Package lots of e-books on a pay-what-you-can basis, or whatever
  people would like (support/subscription?)
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Learning from people
<ul>
<li><code>[&nbsp;]</code> Identify interesting people to learn from
<ul>
<li>Hmm&hellip; is there a way I can do this more efficiently? Scanning
      the first 50 Google Blog Search results gets me 5
      high-quality resources, which I could probably filter just
      based on the titles alone.
</li>
<li>Huh. This could be harder than I thought, because I'm not that
      happy with the resources that are out there. Maybe I should
      figure out a better strategy.
</li>
<li>What do I want in terms of learning from people?
<ul>
<li>Write blog posts with links to other people's interesting perspectives
</li>
<li>Slowly collect interesting people to follow in my feed reader
</li>
<li>Keep in mind the specialties of my blog readers and other
        people who don't blog on their own
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Possible outsourcing approach
<ul>
<li>SPEC: Given a topic, give me an outline or spreadsheet
       highlighting bloggers who have written good blog posts about the
       topic
<ul>
<li>well-written (good English, few grammar or spelling mistakes,
          good paragraph separation, maybe uses bold/color/italics for
          emphasis)
</li>
<li>includes personal experiences, not just generic advice or reblogging
</li>
<li>includes action items or recommendations
</li>
<li>includes links to other resources (and not just
          selling content or promoting a business)
</li>
<li>discussed: has at least two comments, one of which should be
          a reply from the author (unless the post is less than a week old)
</li>
<li>active: at least 1 post a month, and has posted recently
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Rubric:
<ul>
<li>Excellent: 
<ul>
<li>Went through ~10 pages of Google search results and
            narrowed it down to 5-10 excellent items
</li>
<li>Highlighted bloggers or websites who wrote repeatedly
            about a topic, browsing through categories or tags to find
            related posts
</li>
<li>Added a short description of how the pages differ from
            each other
            differ from each other  
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Good:
<ul>
<li>Went through ~5 pages of Google search results and narrowed it
            down to 5-10 good articles
</li>
<li>Organized the list of articles to put excellent/insightful
            blogs at the top
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Mediocre: 
<ul>
<li>Sends a list of URLs with no explanations
</li>
<li>Includes blog posts that are generic, self-promotional
            advice
</li>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm thinking of investing more in my blog, maybe experimenting with.
</li>
<li>NOT
<ul>
<li>having someone "spin" keyword-laden content for me
</li>
<li>someone to keep me accountable re: writing - it's already a habit =)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Why
<ul>
<li>I want to get better at writing
</li>
<li>One way: Identify and deliberately practice <a href="#sec-3-4">blogging skills</a>
<ul>
<li>Current focus areas
<ul>
<li>Outlining (mostly comfortable; need to get to the point of calibrating outline to ~100 words?)
</li>
<li>Synthesizing information (lists, etc.), bringing everything together with a conclusion or recommendations
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Next steps
<ol>
<li>Write better headlines 
</li>
<li>End strong: conclusion, call to action, question
</li>
<li>Start strong: improve first paragraph
</li>
<li>Pick better post topics (research, feedback, etc.)
</li>
<li>Get into the habit of sending newsletter e-mail, maybe for upcoming blog posts
</li>
<li>Get into the habit of updating, organizing, and packaging information resources
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>Doing this, having fun, making progress.
<ul>
<li>Hmm, might be interesting to think about how to measure this progress
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Another way: coaching
<ul>
<li>Ideally, someone with better skills
<ul>
<li>Model excellence and call their shots
</li>
<li>Give feedback on gaps
</li>
<li>Help me teach others
</li>
<li>Ideal scenario?
<ul>
<li>We pick a skill to focus on, like synthesizing information
</li>
<li>They recommend some of their favourite role models
</li>
<li>We come up with exercises or challenges (I'm currently listify-ing at least one post per week; ditto stock photos)
</li>
<li>(We might be able to skip the research part for now, as that's time-consuming and lower-value than planning/editing.)
</li>
<li>They help me improve the logical organization of the outline
</li>
<li>They help me improve the transitions and organization of the draft post
</li>
<li>We brainstorm better headlines and calls to action / questions for the audience
<ul>
<li>Also, related Twitter post?
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Even a different perspective is useful
<ul>
<li>Check whether something makes sense
<ul>
<li>I don't care about typos if the meaning stays the same
</li>
<li>I care about good headlines and saying clear, useful, time-saving, non-obvious things
</li>
<li>I care about explaining things that people might find confusing
<ul>
<li>I might write a blog post for an advanced audience, but it would be good to flag what needs to be explained for intermediate audiences etc. and then fill that in with blog posts later on
<ul>
<li>How to map this out?  
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>I care about tightening things up and making transitions smooth
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Need more precise feedback than "It doesn't work." I want to see alternatives.
</li>
<li>Learning how to put my editing hat on
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Brainstorming/planning stage?
<ul>
<li>Outline, notes, quotes, examples, questions
</li>
<li>Follow-up blog posts
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Also possibly useful: research and editing help
<ul>
<li>People will search using different keywords and sources than I might
</li>
<li>Good for prioritizing lots of resources
<ul>
<li>Value depends
<ul>
<li>Do I read faster than they do? Can I filter through resources faster?
</li>
<li>Do they have similar or better prioritization functions? Am I wowed by their choices?
</li>
<li>Comparative advantage?  
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Is the following the ideal scenario for that? This is some time in the future, though, after I get used to working with other people while writing.
<ul>
<li>I send the person an outline and some notes, and he or she
          sends back summaries of the best resources with citations
          and links. I add personal stories (this comes after research
          because I want to apply advice and it's better than just
          searching for confirmatory evidence) and publish.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Good for editing transcripts and misc. documents too, possibly handling some of the regular publishing (ex: sketchnotes or updates)?
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Process tips? 
<ul>
<li>Tools and processes are harder to transfer
</li>
<li>Metacognition?  
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Good to have a safety net: at some point, I anticipate being more frazzled. This is part of life.
<ul>
<li>I could do what other people do and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> blog, but it's more fun to learn from the conversation.
</li>
<li>Good to have someone doublecheck that I'm making sense
</li>
<li>Make sure that I'm writing useful stuff instead of focusing too much on my life
<ul>
<li>Yes, it's a personal blog, but I may as well be useful at the same time =)
</li>
<li>And also check that I'm not <i>too</i> impersonal, because that would be boring
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Do some of that research, maybe?
</li>
<li>Investment in ongoing learning and connection
<ul>
<li>May need to prioritize
</li>
<li>or may just need to learn how to put my editing hat on
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Justifying value
<ul>
<li>Competing options
<ul>
<li>Options
<ul>
<li>Do it myself
<ul>
<li>I'm doing pretty well
</li>
<li>Lots of great tips out there
</li>
<li>I'm nowhere near the limit of what I can learn for free or from experience
</li>
<li>Use books and role models for passive guidance
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Learn from people's feedback
<ul>
<li>This is great! People comment and share
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Find or start a blogging mastermind group
<ul>
<li>Group insight, more perspectives
</li>
<li>Group plans, support; building relationships
<ul>
<li>Casual examples: Mel Chua, Trevor Lohrbeer, Timothy Kenny - no formal connections between them, but good conversations
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Advantages of coach/assistant
<ul>
<li>Opportunity for targeted, skilled, consistent feedback 
</li>
<li>Learn more about delegation and coaching
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Justifying investment
<ul>
<li>Worth an experiment
<ul>
<li>How long? Extent?
<ul>
<li>As-needed basis
</li>
<li>Risk: I might forget to assign work
<ul>
<li>I should prepare and assign work up front
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Once a week, at least a month?
<ul>
<li>What does this look like?
<ul>
<li>Google Docs or Draft, e-mail notifications
<ul>
<li>&hellip; because I'm unlikely to find someone who can commit straight to Github ;)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Google Hangout chat for clarification/discussion if needed
</li>
<li>Probably 2-3 hours a week, picking one post to focus on
<ul>
<li>make it awesome and link-worthy!
<ul>
<li>although the easiest way to do that is to go and sketchnote something (book review, talk, resource, etc.)
</li>
<li>goal is to learn how to do this with just writing, or with a combination of writing and <i>some</i> graphics  
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>How does this compare with previous experiment with editing?
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/11/thinking-about-how-i-can-make-the-most-of-editing-the-world-is-an-amazing-candy-store-of-talent/">http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/11/thinking-about-how-i-can-make-the-most-of-editing-the-world-is-an-amazing-candy-store-of-talent/</a>
</li>
<li>Not as focused on wordsmithing 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/12/editing-feedback-on-the-shy-connector/">http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/12/editing-feedback-on-the-shy-connector/</a>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>How am I better at writing now?
<ul>
<li>Outlines, illustrations
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>What would be worth it?
<ul>
<li>At the end of the experiment
<ul>
<li>Good: I'm more comfortable synthesizing key points from research and stitching them together in a smooth, non-plagiaristic way that adds value
</li>
<li>Awesome: I wrap up the post with a good conclusion, a call to action, and a question
</li>
<li>Amazing: I have a better sense of headlines, and a plan for testing/improving
<ul>
<li>Okay with needing different coaches - work with people's strengths

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>How to continue justifying the experiment
<ul>
<li>Canada Revenue Agency: must be business-related expense with expectation of income
</li>
<li>Deeper feedback versus superficial feedback, explaining what's going on 
<ul>
<li>Ex: reorganizing the logic of a piece and explaining why, instead of making tiny word changes (remove "just", etc. - useful, but not as useful as the other kind of feedback)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Sell information products or courses, maybe on a pay-what-you-can basis 
</li>
<li>Use as a regular weekly sanity-check for batch processing
<ul>
<li>Grant access to Wordpress?
</li>
<li>Work out a different workflow, maybe Evernote? (Evernote doesn't paste well)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<li>Why
<ul>
<li>Make decisions quickly
<ul>
<li>Discard choices that are obviously worse
</li>
<li>Jump on opportunities
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Make decisions more reasonably

</li>
<li>Don't forget important criteria; value of a checklist

<p>
The point of scenario planning, after all, is not to be right, which
is such a human inclination that we find it hard to overcome—the point
of scenario planning is to see the future from perspectives we would
have a difficult time forcing ourselves to imagine because of our bias
toward rightness, and therefore imagine new possibilities or see
threats we might otherwise miss.
The trick is to know we will always be wrong as we speculate about the
future

Yet, the purpose of scenario planning is not to pinpoint future events
but to highlight large-scale forces that push the future in different
directions. It's about making these forces visible, so that if they do
happen, the planner will at least recognize them. It's about helping
make better decisions today.

<p>
I’ve been reading through Mr. Money Mustache’s blog archive, and his blog post on What would you do with WAY MORE money? made me think about what I value and what I would change. Like him, I’m comfortable with the way things are. I like eating at home. I like getting books and movies from the library instead of buying them. (No storage or waste issues, wide selection, and the satisfaction of boosting library circulation statistics…) I like my hobbies and interests. I like my freedom from the endless hedonic treadmill.
Not even the latest apps or gadgets, aside from the occasional experiment. (Shh! I hope they don’t take away my geek card. ;) )
About the only thing that would be awesomer would be to make more frequent trips to the Philippines (maybe every year! or on a whim!) or to join family and friends on their vacations. Although that’s constrained by other things too, like the fact that I like spending time with W- and he needs to be here in Toronto for J-.

<h3 id="sec-9-10">What's worth spending on?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-10">

<p>I'd been contemplating this question for the past four years.
</p>
<p>
What's worth spending on? I invest for the future, save for unexpected expenses, and support causes and people - but it's good to have that discretionary part of my budget which I can use to enjoy life and learn how to make better decisions.
</p>
<p>
Many people care about stuff. I apporeciate that. There are many examples of things that have enabled me to enjoy and learn from life so much more, such as my tablet PC.
</p>
<p>
Many people care about experiences. I appreciate that, too. I like how experiences can lead to deeper relationships.
</p>
<p>
Many people know something else that I'm just beginning to figure out. You can spend on people, on time, on making things happen. This is awesome! There's a candy store of talent out there - a world full of people with unique experiences, skills, and passions.
</p>
<p>
Like the way I've learned about what works well for me in terms of
spending on stuff and experiences, I want to learn how to spend on
making things happen. And who knows? If I can get good enough at it,
maybe I can learn how to create so much value that it becomes a
self-perpetuating machine.

(personal motivation)
More than anything, I wanted time. Ever since I was a kid, I had
always been acutely aware of how short a time we actually have. (Can I
blame this on reading about Raistlin's hourglass eyes in Dragonlance,
which I suppose was my first introduction to Stoic negative
visualization?) Being halfway around the world from family is hard
enough. I see the time pass for my parents in their Facebook pictures
and on our Skype calls. As for here, W- is much older than I am, and I
want to make the most of the time that I have with him.

One of the people I was chatting with was interested in measuring
productivity. As I started thinking about it, I realized that I care
about making sure I’m not breaking many promises. Sometimes I slip up,
and then I know I have to slow down and take my time. I’m curious
about some things that might improve my effectiveness (dictation or
podcasting for these posts, to make the words flow better? automated
tests for my coding? visual vocabularies for my drawing?), but they
tend to be more qualitative than&hellip;

But my own favorite part of the book was in the description of the “Renaissance Man ideal”. This is the idea that you will have the most enjoyable life, AND the best chance at very early financial independence, by developing a whole load of interesting skills. The amazing part is that these skills don’t just sit independently in your mind like a bunch of unused kitchen appliances in a pantry. They start to reach out and connect to each other in unexpected ways, and start solving all of your problems for you. They build your curiosity and start sucking in still more skills that you can’t help acquiring. And before you know it, you are able to live a superb life on only a tiny fraction of the spending that a normal person does, even while you might end up accidentally earning money even more easily than before you embraced the Renaissance Ideal.

It’s been more than ten years since David Allen published Getting
Things Done. I still haven’t come up with a fully trustable system,
but Emacs + Org + Evernote is getting there. I’m glad I’m back to
using Org. I’m starting to run into the reminders I set for important
business paperwork last year, and I might have missed that if I was
relying on my memory or my calendar.
</p>
<p>
From time to time, when I catch myself feeling frazzled, I stop and
write down all of my open loops: the things that tug on my attention.
Some of them must be ruthlessly demoted to “someday/maybe,” or even
let go. And then I can methodically go through the others, crossing
them off as I finish them. Getting it all down on paper helps me make
sense of things and stops me from feeling overwhelmed.

Ditto - want more of a collection view

<p>
Decision criteria:
</p><ul>
<li>must be able to organize clips into collections that don't get buried under new clips (can select collection)

<p>
Sometimes people tell me that they can’t believe I’m introverted. You
organize meetups, they say. You share a lot online. You can’t possibly
be introverted. Not only do I need to recharge after conferences or
other intense social interactions, I like being introverted – it’s
good to be comfortable with yourself. That said, you learn a lot when
you bump into other people, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to
have more of those serendipitous conversations.
</p>
<p>
I like group conversations more than one-on-ones because I get to
learn from the intersections of people’s interests. I see different
aspects of people than I might bring out on my own. Group
conversations also reduce the pressure to carry the conversation
myself – people bring their own questions and tips and ideas to the
table.
</p>
<p>
I’m particularly interested in virtual meetups because there are so
many wonderful people out there whom I will probably never be in the
same city with. Toronto is a great meetup city because there’s always
something going on, but there’s no reason why knowledge-sharing should
be unnecessarily privileged or limited by geographic proximity. If
people are curious about blogging, drawing, Emacs, Quantified Self, or
whatever we have in common, maybe we can have virtual show-and-tells
instead of relying on the probability of finding critical mass for a
meetup in our own areas.
</p>
<p>
---
I get my energy from a quiet and simple life. I’ve learned to say no
when I need more space: no if I need quiet instead of networking (even
if there could be someone who could change my life or vice versa just
over there); no if I need silence instead of a taxi cab conversation;
no to people’s requests in favour of spending time with W- or on my
own projects.
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to learn how to say no, or even to learn that you can. “Say
yes to everything,” the advice goes. Seize the day. Grab those
opportunities.
</p>
<p>
But there’s a lot of power in being able to listen to your needs and
carve out the time and space that you need—to meet the world on your
own terms, and to be happy to give because you’re ready to do so.

<h3 id="sec-11-2">Hacking my way into meeting people</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-2">

<p>I try to minimize the number of things I’ve promised to other people
so that I have the flexibility to follow opportunities when they come
up. Conversations are an exception. It’s hard to not schedule those if
I want to make sure they happen at some point. Left to my own devices,
I might never get around to talking to people. So I pay someone a
small amount to handle my scheduling, which neatly removes me from the
back-and-forth hassles of coordinating times and also (useful and
possibly more important!) prevents me from giving myself excuses not
to do it. Then I remind myself that getting to and from these
appointments is either reading time or free exercise (for in-person
meetings), or possible podcast or blog material (if online). Introvert
hack. =)

<p>
We have a computer downstairs with backups of files, and I've been using it to explore Vagrant and development using virtual machines as well. It can be useful to be able to SSH into it from outside our network, so I spent some time setting up a dynamic domain name, port forwarding, and new limits for the SSH server.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> (the domain name registrar that I use) supports dynamic domains, so it was easy to enable.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable dynamic domains: <b>Manage Domains</b>, choose the domain, and then choose <b>Dynamic DNS</b>. Enable it and copy the password.
</li>
<li>Create an A record: Choose <b>All Records</b> and add a subdomain with a temporary address (ex: 127.0.0.1) and type <b>A</b>. Save the settings.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Our router uses the <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato firmware</a>, which has built-in support for Namecheap and other dynamic DNS provider.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <b>Basic</b> - <b>DDNS</b>.
</li>
<li>Fill in the details for <b>Dynamic DNS 1</b>.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Before I forwarded the ports, I wanted to make sure that SSH permitted password authentication on our local network but required passphrases for external connections. <a href="http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/818">OpenSSH: requiring keys, but allow passwords from some locations</a> (Michael W. Lucas) was really helpful. I edited <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, set <code>PasswordAuthentication no</code>, and added the following lines to the end of the file:
</p>



<pre class="example">Match Address 192.168.0.0/16
  PasswordAuthentication yes
</pre>


<p>
(I had some problems in the beginning because I typed this as <code>Yes</code> instead of <code>yes</code>&hellip; Case matters!)
</p>
<p>
I restarted the SSH server with <code>service ssh restart</code> and confirmed that I could still SSH in. 
</p>
<p>
Back to Tomato. <b>Port Forwarding</b> lets you set up forwarding rules. The port for SSH is 22, so I filled in a row with the port I wanted, the internal port, and the internal IP address of the server. I clicked <b>Save</b> (forgot to do this a few times because the button was near the end of the page) and that was that.
</p>
<p>
On Windows, I walked W- through generating a DSA public key with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuttyGEN</a>, loading it in <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">Pageant</a>, and copying it to his <code>.ssh/authorized_keys2</code> file.
</p>
<p>
Posting this here because I'm probably going to want to do this again someday, and it took some searching around. Besides, someone might find it handy!

I've been thinking about <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/08/thinking-about-how-to-type-faster/">how to type faster than 110wpm</a>, and digging
into the specific factors that I could improve. In particular, I
wanted to get a sense of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>my theoretical top speed
</li>
<li>whether alternates or rolls are better for me
</li>
<li>how quickly I can twitch, measured by single-key repeats or two-key alternations
</li>
</ul>


<p>
By using totally artificial typing tests (ex: type "thththth&hellip;") instead of word-based ones, I can explore the relationships between character combinations and speed without worrying about hitting SPC, sounding out words, correcting errors, and so on. Since I can do the tests in short sprints, I can rest enough in between to minimize my risk of RSI.

I haven't come across an online typing test that gives the kind of
stats I want, or even a per-character or digram breakdown. I thought
about writing a Javascript-based typing timer, but I figured it would
be less work to cajole Emacs into measuring what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
Here's the code:
</p>



<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">sacha/timer-go</span> ()
  <span class="org-doc">"Quick keyboard timer."</span>
  (interactive)
  (insert <span class="org-string">"GO\n"</span>)
  (run-with-timer 3 nil (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> () (insert <span class="org-string">"\n"</span>)))  <span class="org-comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="org-comment">for warmup</span>
  (run-with-timer 15 nil (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> () <span class="org-comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="org-comment">12 seconds + the 3-second warmup</span>
                           (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((col (- (point) (line-beginning-position))))
                             (insert (format <span class="org-string">" | %d | \n"</span> col)))
                           )))
(local-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"&lt;f7&gt;"</span>) 'sacha/timer-go)
</pre>


<p>
This prints "GO" to show you that it's running. You have three seconds to warm up, so you don't have to worry about wasting any milliseconds after <code>M-x sacha/timer-go</code> (or <code>F7</code>, the keyboard shortcut I bound mine to). After the warmup, Emacs adds a newline and the "race" is on. There's a 12 second period of actual typing, and then Emacs adds the number of characters you typed. When you see that, you can stop.
</p>
<p>
Twelve seconds is a useful number for estimating typing speed because the conversion from characters per minute (CPM) to words per minute (WPM) usually uses a factor of 5: CPM / 5 = WPM. So the number of characters you can type in <code>60 seconds / 5</code> is probably the number of "words" you could type in a minute. Testing your speed on trivial patterns (ex: 
ththththththththth)
</p>
<p>
Note: L and R refer to left and right hand. I've also numbered the fingers with 1 being the thumb and 5 being the pinky. The patterns I used are based on a Dvorak keyboard, but that doesn't matter as much. Just figure out what the equivalent patterns are on your preferred keyboard layout.
</p>
<p>
Limitations: I didn't do any special calculations to deal with errors (there were many doubling or transposition errors multi-character sequences), so the actual CPM will be lower. Also, repeated character sequences are definitely not normal and have quirks of their own. It's interesting to establish the range and see the kinds of errors that show up when I go faster than I'm comfortable with, though. 
</p>

<p>
If you don't care what you're typing, it's easy to type quickly. This is just about how fast my hands go if I don't have to think about which finger to activate. This mostly ended up as alternating left- and right-hand rolls (ex: aoeusntoahuesnto). Because I didn't have to precisely alternate, two-handed mashing resulted in more characters than one-handed mashing. Interestingly, my right hand is slightly faster than my left.

<p>
I expected rolls to be faster than alternates, but it turns out that alternating works out fine too ("the" and "and" on a Dvorak keyboard). Same-hand rolls had fewer errors than alternates, though - timing can be tricky when doing high-speed repeats. That can be partially handled by autocorrecting "teh" to "the" and similar transpositions. I use an AutoHotkey-based autocorrect script, but it screws up the typing tests I like, so I can't take advantage of it then. A roll-optimized keyboard layout might be more effective.
</p>
<p>
3- and 4-character rolls like the ones I tested aren't that common in actual typing, but it might be possible to find keyboard layouts that are better-optimized for the languages I use. I've read that Arensito, Capewell, and Colemak focus more on rolls and alternating rolls, so they might be worth a look.

<p>
Two-character patterns are slower than three-character patterns, probably indicating that there's a small delay as I think about repeating things. Alternates and same-hand two-character pairs seem to work okay. Even for same-hand two-character pairs, I get the occasional doubling or transposition error.
</p>

<p>
Single-finger keypresses (no automatic repeats) are slow. Good thing I don't have to do them that often. If this represents the speed at which I can send an impulse to my finger and have it do something, this might be a limiting factor for my typing speed, which is compensated for by alternates and rolls. 
</p>

<p>
Moving my fingers takes time too. Also, did you know that there are typing equivalents of tongue-twisters? I can't type "ranranranran&hellip;" a long time without it turning into rna and other permutations. Maybe my brain gets hiccups.
</p>


<h3>Interrupted combinations</h3>

<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" /><col class="right" />

</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Alternating hands is actually pretty tough if you have to care about
timing. Oddly, this is slower than repositioning. Maybe it's because
the repositioning helps me remember where I am in the word when I'm
repeating it, so natural typing will be a different case.
</p>


<h3>Wrap-up<h3>

<p>
Chunking seems to make a big difference for me. 4-character combinations tend to beat 3-character combinations and those tend to beat 2-character combinations, unless there's some timing involved. Common combinations (the, and) are easier to type. If I can get better at chunking words into syllables, that might help. The most common digraphs are
TH, HE, AN, IN, ER, ON, RE, ED, ND, HA, AT, EN, ES, OF, NT, EA, TI, TO, IO, LE, IS, OU, AR, AS, DE, RT, and VE (<a href="http://scottbryce.com/cryptograms/stats.htm">source</a>), so that might be good to look at next.
</p>
<p>
Twitching or moving individual fingers are slow operations, so being able to "look ahead" and move my fingers to the right spots while I'm typing the first few characters helps. Muscle memory also helps minimize errors.
</p>
<p>
Also, maybe finger dexterity and agility exercises?
</p>
<p>
I'm probably in the region of Diminishing Returns here. I could spend hours inching up my typing speed&hellip; or I could spend that time doing other things. Now that I've identified specific areas to look into, though, I might be able to set up exercises to take advantage of interstitial time. For example, while I'm reading a book, I could do finger dexterity exercises (pausing, of course, if I feel any hint of strain - I'd like to avoid RSI if I can).
</p>
<p>
On another note, testing my theoretical speed in this way reminded me a little of how we used to play Decathlon on the computer as kids. (Was it <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/microsoft-decathlon/screenshots">Microsoft Decathlon</a>? The screenshots look familiar&hellip;) Somehow our keyboard survived the rampage back then. =)

Every so often, I go through my list and remove plugins I don't use as much in order to reduce memory use and improve security. Still, with thousands of plugins available on <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins</a>, there are always more ways to make blogs better. (Come to think of it, I should probably add a SEO-focused plugin too. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> seems popular&hellip;) Hope this list of favourites helps!

</li>
<li>Assumptions are helpful
<ul>
<li>They simplify the world
</li>
<li>They make it possible to make quick decisions. Making assumptions
    helps us take advantage of our past experiences, and we can learn
    from other people's experiences as well.

<li>Otherwise, you'd get stuck verifying everything

</li>
<li>Why is it hard
<ul>
<li>Don't know your assumptions
</li>
<li>Intimidated by measuring
</li>
<li>Don't want to be wrong
</li>
<li>Behaviour is hard to change.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Time
<ul>
<li>Most likely the first thing you need to examine. If you always
    feel rushed for time, you won't have the space to question and
    explore your assumptions.

<p>Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

Saturday afternoon. It had started raining, so W- put away his tools and stopped working on the deck stairs. He asked if I wanted to go out and do something fun – maybe watch a movie, or have pho? 
</p>
<p>
I checked the movie listings. Nothing particularly worth watching on the big screen instead of on our television, and we had food in the fridge. So we stayed home, watched one of the movies we’d checked out from the library, and enjoyed some home-made pizza.
</p>
<p>
We haven’t been to a movie theatre in ages (ever since I decided that actually, even superhero blockbusters are just fine on the small screen). The library is the source of a constant stream of DVDs. While there are long waits for the latest releases, there are plenty of old movies we can go through. I’ve gotten accustomed to watching with subtitles and the ability to pause or rewind, which is great since many movies involve at least one mumbly moment. Besides, if we watch at home, we can make jokes.
</p>
<p>
I am such a homebody. My default is to spend time at home, and I enjoy it. I love reading, writing, drawing, coding. Tidying up is slightly less fun, but it’s also useful. We’re not hermits – we go to the supermarket, the library, the hardware store – but we don’t often go out just for recreation.
</p>
<p>
I go out occasionally – more often than W- goes out. I go to the clients’ offices. I go to HackLab to hang out with other geeks and learn from them. I go to friends’ get-togethers. And then I come home and recharge.
</p>
<p>
Back when I lived at home, my parents took me and my sisters out a lot: eating at restaurants, strolling through the malls. I hardly go shopping here, aside from the occasional stressful sprint when I need to restock my shoes or clothes. I hardly go to restaurants, either. When I get together with friends, it’s usually in someone’s kitchen. 
</p>
<p>
I think the trick is to embrace it instead of wondering what other people are doing.

<li>Canada Post lost the passport that was sent through Xpresspost, so
  I need to go through the process of filing for a lost passport:
  official statement, police report, affidavit of
  loss, a rather high lost passport replacement fee, and another
  two months of waiting.

</li>
<li>I was not happy to find out they had lost my passport. I pouted and
  indulged in getting a few hugs from W-, who happened to be working
  from home at the time.

</li>
<li>Cheering up, I said, "I've never lost a passport before. Well, at
  least I get to learn how the process works!" I started singing,
  "Always look on the bright side of life&hellip;"

</li>
<li>"Okay, that's a bit of a stretch," W- said. But I think he was
  happy that I could bounce back easily. I know I was.

<li>Here is something I'm starting to learn about life: situations
  aren't bad or good, they're just different.

(snippet from life)
Since she doesn’t like taking classes or workshops, she can use that
time to get better at teaching herself. I don’t like taking classes
either, so I know what that’s like. I should probably hack my way
around that, though. There are many things that might be more cost- or
time-effective for me to learn in a class than on my own or from
books.

<p>When I project my current paths out to their peaks, I learn a lot about where I want to go and how I want to get there. For example, I'm currently learning about sales by selling sketchnoting services. I'm starting with that because it's relatively easy to appreciate (yay visuals!), there are established companies in other geographies that have tested the business model and value proposition, and people want it. There's a lot of room to grow. If I imagine being a super-sketchnoter or a super-illustrator, though, I feel like there's something missing. I feel like the focus is on interpreting someone else's ideas instead of creating something marvelous and new. Artists create new things, and there's something fascinating in that.

<p>
A few of my friends want to learn more about cooking, going beyond eating out or occasionally making a bowl of pasta at home. It’s a welcome change, and I’m looking forward to more and more people making that shift. 
</p>
<p>
For some people, it seems a point of pride to not know how to cook: they’re too busy to sit down and do that, or there are so many good restaurants out there, or cooking is just plain not enjoyable. For us, cooking is part of our way of life. We can cook most meals for much cheaper than we can buy them, and our weekday meals are more convenient than eating out. I love being able to have my favourite foods at any time of day. Despite the occasional drudgery, I’ve grown to enjoy cooking – especially when W- and I spend a few hours putting together something delicious.
</p>
<p>
I thought I'd reflect on past 10 years of learning how to cook to see what I learned and how I learned it. When I started, I struggled with the basics: burning pancakes, trying to figure out how to use ground beef in different recipes. Now we can make lists based on the grocery fliers, adjust our plans based on what's marked down for quick sale, and stock our freezer with meals to last us through the week.
</p>


<h3>B.C. - Before Cooking</h3>

<p>
Growing up, I hadn't imagined being this comfortable with cooking. My sister was the cook in the family, the one with an intuitive sense of what went with what. She took whatever was in the fridge and made something delicious with it, no recipe required. We enjoyed the occasional meal she prepared for us, and she told us stories of how cooking helped her make friends while travelling. The rest of the time, we were spoiled by the fact that family business&ndash;advertising photography&ndash;retained a cook to feed clients, staff, and us.
</p>
<p>
I wasn't totally hopeless. I helped in the kitchen, and I loved making lasagna together with my mom. I took cooking lessons one summer. I mainly learned that following recipes produced reasonable results. At home, I occasionally made myself instant noodles or reheated pork and beans, but I didn't really have the motivation to cook.
</p>


<h3>Cook or Die</h3>

<p>
That changed a few months after I graduated from university. I had just turned twenty, and I was teaching computer science at my alma mater. To cut down on the commuting time, we found an apartment-style dormitory near the campus. Each unit was shared by two people, and there was an unfurnished kitchen. My parents outfitted it with a hot plate (a single electric burner, which was all the dormitory allowed), a toaster oven, a microwave, and a compact fridge. 
There were a number of fast food restaurants in walking distance that I'd frequented as a student, but I resolved that my grown-up life shouldn't involve KFC every lunch and dinner. There was a supermarket a bit of the way up the street. To force myself to learn how to cook, I decided that I would eat out for at most one meal a day. If I didn't cook, I'd go hungry. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie/">Cook or die</a>. (Well, that was an exaggeration, but it was a good project name.)
</p>
<p>
Did I mention that my apartment didn't have Internet access? I know. Boggle.
</p>
<p>
It was&hellip; interesting. I loaded up on kid- and singles- and microwave-oriented cookbooks, and occasionally made things up just as an experiment. You may find <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/cookordie/?order=asc">my blog posts from that time</a> amusing. Here's a summary of the first two weeks:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-1/">Day 1</a>: Hungarian sausages and pita pockets - not terribly appetizing, but edible enough. 
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-2-veal-sausage-and-potatoes/">Day 2</a>: I discovered that pita pockets are called pita <b>pockets</b> for a reason.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-3-more-sausages/">Day 3</a>: Figured out that pre-slicing the ingredients speeded up assembly.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-4/">Day 4</a>: Ate the same thing.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-5-more-sausages/">Day 5</a>: The remaining pitas were moldy. Discovered the power of freezing.
</li>

<p>
As you can see, I was a bit of a slow learner. ;)
</p>
<p>
Eventually I graduated to being confident enough in a few recipes that were ready for company. I was living in an exclusive girls' domitory, so no guys were allowed inside the units. That meant my friends could help me with groceries and give me tips, but they couldn't actually help me learn how to cook unless I was home for the weekend. The dormitory did have a garden with picnic tables and some shelter, though, and both male and female guests were welcome there. We worked out this weekly rotation, and I had dinner with someone practically every day. I particularly enjoyed being able to prepare individual-sized portions of lasagna rolls using the recipe in one of my microwave cookbooks. Even in pouring storms, friends would come and join me. It was wonderful.
</p>
<p>
I enjoyed teaching, but I left that to take advantage of a technical internship that the Japanese government was offering. In the in-between months, I stayed at home. In Japan, I stayed at a hotel-type dormitory with a cafeteria. There was hardly any cooking, although I did develop an appreciation for the sheer variety of ramen (instant or otherwise) available in Japan.
</p>


<h3>Graduate student life</h3>

<p>
When I moved to Canada for graduate school, I made sure I was in an apartment-style residence with a kitchen and a small shared living room. I shared my unit with three other people, and the mix changed each semester or so. There was a 24-hour supermarket within walking distance (somewhat expensive, but convenient) and other markets available a long walk or a short streetcar ride down the street. 
</p>


<p>
I made friends: some students who lived in the building, and other people I met in my studies or research. I often invited a couple of friends over for dinner, usually something experimental - a stir-fry, or chicken breast and sauce, or whatever recipe intrigued me. From time to time, I took advantage of the large common outdoor party/barbeque area.
At some point, I decided I was grown-up enough to want my own set of plates instead of the mismatched hand-me-downs, so I headed over to Walmart and splurged on a set of Corelle, a rice cooker, a teapot, and other essentials. 
</p>
<p>
There were occasional group cooking lessons in the residence, open to whoever signed up. I liked them. We split up into small groups and prepared different recipes such as roasted red pepper soup, and then we got to enjoy the tastes of all the recipes together.
</p>
<p>
The administration decided on the mix of roommates based on the questionnaires we submitted. I didn't always get along with my room-mates, one of whom tended to abscond with my dishes without returning them. (I lost a couple of cereal bowls this way.) When I had finished most of my research and lined up a job at IBM, I decided it was time to look for my own apartment. Of all the ones I looked at, my favourite was a one-bedroom apartment across the street. The rent was a little high and the kitchen was <i>tiny</i>, but I was looking forward to cooking without squabbling over fridge space or dishes in the sink.
</p>


<h3>Cooking with W-</h3>

<p>
I was a relative newcomer to Canada, so the building management didn't want to prepare a lease without a co-signer. Of all my friends, W- was probably the stablest and most respectable. He knew I managed my finances well and had the year's rent set aside, so he didn't have to worry about being on the hook for it. In preparation for the move, I'd boxed up my kitchen tools and resolved to live on peanut butter sandwiches like my mom had done in university. W- took pity on me and invited me over for dinner. These scrumptious home-made meals became a regular occurrence.
</p>
<p>
We signed the paperwork and moved my stuff (easy across the street, especially with a skateboard), I feathered my nest and set up my tiny kitchen. As a housewarming present, W- gave me Happy Bunny socks with witty slogans, since I'd mentioned my sister's trick of happy socks. As a kitchen-warming present, he gave me a basic set of Wusthof Classic knives. (Embarrassed by the generosity of the gift, I tried to talk him out of it, but he insisted that good tools make all the difference.)
</p>
<p>
They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Apparently, this is true for women too. Even though the paperwork was done, W- kept inviting me for delicious meals: crushing basil in a mortar and pestle for pesto, pinakbet (which he had learned how to make long before meeting me, so it was fun to encounter this familiar dish), a comparison of two lasagna recipes. I assisted, of course: chopping, stirring, learning more about cooking. Sometimes I invited W- or other people over to my place for whatever simple dishes I could prepare with my minimal kitchen setup; the knives made preparation a joy even in the cramped space. 
</p>
<p>
Eventually we realized we were in love. I sublet my apartment and moved in. I brought my cherished knives and selected kitchen tools, leaving the rest for my tenant.
</p>
<p>
After my tiny kitchen, W-'s kitchen was a real treat. Cast-iron skillets, a decent-sized wok, <i>two</i> rice cookers (large and small), a low-cost supermarket up the street, a garden to grow herbs in, a large kitchen table that we ended up spending most of our time at&hellip; I volunteered to be the sous chef as often as I could. Over time, I took the lead in making more meals. I learned family favourites and we discovered new ones together. Cooking with W- made learning <i>fun</i> - we could celebrate successes and gamely finish anything that wasn't an absolute failure.
</p>
<p>
Cooking was part of W-'s way of life, and I was delighted to make it part of mine too. We rarely ate out. It just wasn't convenient during schooldays, and cooking was more frugal anyway. From March 2007 to August 2009 (30 months), I logged $145/month for groceries for 2.5 people (85%) and $25/month for dining out (15%). The actual numbers are different because W- picked up some groceries and usually treated me when dining out, although we set up this system where I contributed a fixed amount to household expenses so it worked out anyway.
</p>
<p>
We periodically tweaked the kitchen to improve the way we worked. We moved the canned goods from the basement into an industrial-style shelving unit. We moved the microwave to a custom shelf and freed up the rolling table it had been on, which turned out to have an excellent cutting surface on top of it - more counter space! Little tweaks like that made cooking more efficient and more fun.
</p>
<p>
I'd been reading about the benefits of a chest freezer on frugality blogs. We weren't sure if we had the space or if we could make it part of our lifestyle, so we dithered. In 2009, W- and I finally decided to take the plunge. We bought a 5.3 cu-ft freezer and started stocking it with sale items, filling the extra space with water jugs to improve efficiency. Eventually we learned the basics of bulk cooking, discovered which of our favourites froze well, and standardized our food containers for easier organization.
</p>


<p>
We also experimented with community-supported agriculture. It was a
good way to get through lots of vegetables, and Internet recipes were
really helpful. (All that zucchini! All that cabbage!) We eventually
decided to buy our own vegetables, but it was a good experience.
</p>
<p>
Now I've gotten to the point where a 30% markdown on pork tenderloin makes me think of tonkatsu, I can make a stir-fry with whatever vegetables look okay, and cooking is more like fun than a chore.
</p>


<h3>What I learned along the way</h3>

<p>
<b>People make cooking much more fun</b>
</p>
<p>
Cooking by myself was a drag. Cooking for other people was better, because we could enjoy the good stuff and laugh about the dishes that didn't go as well. (You can tell who your friends are - if they eat your experimental cooking, they're good friends!) Cooking <i>with</i> other people was the best, because then you can chat while chopping (carefully) and watch out for each other (looks like the eggs are done!). W- helped me learn so much more about cooking than I probably would have on my own.
</p>
<p>
<b>Good tools really do matter</b>
</p>
<p>
A sharp knife is less dangerous than a dull one because a sharp knife won't slip. W- periodically sharpens the knives, and I try to remember to use the steel before I use the chef's knife. I've also come to really appreciate the convenience of a dough scraper, Microplane graters, and other little kitchen things. That said, we try to minimize the number of unitaskers we have: no egg poachers, no slot toasters, no corn cob holders&hellip; This means our drawers are easier to organize and keep uncluttered.
</p>
<p>
<b>The Internet is awesome</b>
</p>
<p>
The Internet has a gazillion recipes. I used to feel a little intimidated by the variety, but I realized that it meant that recipes are (mostly) just guidelines. Can I skip a spice that I don't normally stock? Can I substitute an ingredient for something I don't have? Do I want to adjust the temperature so that I can bake two different things at the same time? Chances are that someone has a recipe that calls for that, so it should be fine. It might not be amazing, but it will be okay.
</p>
<p>
<b>Absolute failures are very rare</b>
</p>
<p>
There was the time I put the yeast in water that was too hot. My lump of pizza dough didn't rise, and I had to throw it out and start over. Sometimes I burn things and have to scrape off bits. One time I was learning about seasoning cast-iron pans and I heated one for so long that the season flaked off. I broke a rice cooker and repaired it by replacing the thermal fuse. Most of my cooking failures were salvageable, though. It turns out that it's difficult to Completely Mess Things Up, so you should worry less and just go ahead and try it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Chest freezers and bulk cooking make everything easier</b>
</p>
<p>
Cooking in bulk lets us minimize the number of left-over ingredients, especially if we adjust the recipes. Having meals in the freezer is an amazing way to reduce the risk of cooking experimental recipes: if it's an absolute failure, well, there's a guaranteed meal all ready to go. Freezing is also great for dealing with leftovers. If I don't feel like eating the same thing for the rest of the week, I can package it as individual lunches in the freezer for when I feel like having it again.
</p>


<h3>Next steps for me</h3>

<p>
There's plenty more to learn, and I look forward to getting even better at this over the next ten years. Here are some of the skills that would be fun to improve:
</p>
<p>
<b>Regular menu planning and a broader repertoire of recipes</b>
</p>
<p>
You know how some households run on predictable patterns? We do a little of this: soups and baking on the weekends because of time-of-use electricity charges; stir-fries to take advantage of fresh vegetables from our grocery shopping; maybe a vegetarian meal sometime during the week&hellip; It would be good to get even better at planning what we're going to have, perhaps based on a two-week cycle of themes that's adjusted by what's on sale, and to introduce new recipes within that framework.
</p>
<p>
<b>Recycling leftovers into new dishes</b>
</p>
<p>
I tend to be pretty happy eating the same thing again and again (or freezing the leftovers if they've been around a while), but recycling left-overs into new dishes would extend their fridge-life and encourage people to eat them. There are books that focus on cascading one recipe into another, and it seems like a good skill to learn. It's also a quick way to get more variety out of the same cooking effort.
</p>
<p>
<b>Working with different spices and sauces</b>
</p>
<p>
We have a lot of spices in the cabinet. I should make an inventory of them and organize them for easy reach. Sauces are also good ways to give the same basic dish different tastes. If I learn more about flavour, I can stock the freezer and fridge with a wider range of tastes.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-17-1">

<p>This is probably the hardest part of semi-retirement: learning how to
be. Learning to let go of the need to check things off a list or do
things that I consider productive. Learning how to ignore the clock
and follow the flow.
</p>
<p>
Look, I'm writing a blog post instead of staring off into space. This
time, I'm not starting with an outline. We'll just see where this post
goes.
</p>
<p>
It's not all "work." I sleep in, and I go for walks, and I get on my
bike and go to places even if I don't need to. I cook and I read and I
garden. I tidy. I play video games.
</p>
<p>
They're still all verbs. That's okay. The goal isn't to do <i>nothing</i>,
the goal is to be where I am: unhurried, present, not frustrated, not
judging myself for what I do or don't do.
</p>
<p>
Pretty good, actually.

How to say no to opportunities
</p>
<p>
(Needs more work)
</p>
<ul>
<li>When I started this 5-year experiment, I didn't know if I could
  stick with it. My track record for sticking with interests is not
  that good. I'm delighted to report that (semi-)retirement gets
  easier and easier. I am learning to say no.
</li>
<li>By coincidence, two of my mentors (who had moved on to separate
  companies after IBM) got in touch with me recently to find out if I
  was interested in some upcoming job opportunities. Good stuff.
  Right up my alley. Wonderful people.
</li>
<li>I said no. Actually, I said something along the lines of: Thank you
  for reaching out! That sounds fantastic. However, I am semi-retired
  and completely* unhireable for at least the next few years, so I'll
  just have to wish you good luck on your search. I'm sure you'll find
  someone awesome out there.
</li>
<li>(Of course, if a significant financial need comes up, I have no qualms about
  suspending this experiment and returning to the wonderful world
  of work. I enjoyed working with excellent teams. I'd love to do
  it again.
</li>
<li>Learning how to say no is incredibly amazing.
<ul>
<li>It helps to remember that there are other awesome people out there
    who can make things happen. 
</li>
<li>Sure, they might not bring my particular configuration of skills,
    but they'll bring other useful combinations.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>I don't even have a tiny internal voice of dissent
<ul>
<li>because the part that might've been afraid about the future has
    been neatly shut up by a good if&hellip;then&hellip;else&hellip; that postpones
