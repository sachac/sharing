Emacs newbie: Tips for learning keyboard shortcuts
</p>

<p>
The tutorial (C-h t) is useful and well worth going through several times. Getting used to marking a region with C-SPC versus using shift- takes some doing, but it’s really quite powerful once you get the hang of it – mainly because you can then use all sorts of navigational commands without getting RSI.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, you may want to look into mapping your Caps Lock to Control. Many people like the way it makes keyboard shortcuts easier to type.
</p>

<p>
I find it hard to remember keyboard shortucts too, so I use M-x a lot. M-x lets you call a command by its name. You can use C-h k to find out more about which function is called by a given keyboard shortcut, and then you can use M-x to call it by name if you don’t remember where it is. For example, if you don’t remember where split-window-vertically is bound, you can use M-x split-window-vertically.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, M-x where-is will tell you the keyboard shortcuts if you know a function name, and C-h f (describe-function) will give you more information if you give it a function name.
</p>

<p>
Writing-wise, Org Mode (<a href="http://www.orgmode.org">http://www.orgmode.org</a>) is totally awesome. I use it to write some of my more structured blog posts and web pages, and I also use it to keep this gigantic outline of things I’m planning to write about: <a href="http://sach.ac/outline">http://sach.ac/outline</a> . People have used it to write technical books and other lengthy documents. It’s also a fantastic planner for running your daily life. =)
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I want
to help make Emacs easier to learn!
</p>

<p>
Oh, another tip: use M-x icomplete-mode to turn on incremental completion, which will then show you hints when you start typing M-x [command-name]. You can use TAB to complete as far as you can, and then type in a few more characters to disambiguate. To turn this on by default whenever you start Emacs, add the following to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el (you might need to create this file):

</p>

<p>
<i>Michael Jones wanted to know how I organized my Org Mode files. Here's how I do things!</i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode for Emacs</a> is an outliner that lets you add a little structure
to plain text files. Not only can you use it to move around, hide, and
show sections of your outline, but you can also:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>schedule tasks and mark them as complete,
</li>
<li>add hyperlinks and formatting,
</li>
<li>estimate effort and track time,
</li>
<li>export to HTML and other formats,
</li>
<li>and even include code that you can run in-line.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I started with a single Org Mode file (appropriately called
organizer.org), but I've gradually fleshed this out into a number of
files. My goals for organizing my files this way are to be able to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Publish some files while keeping other files private,
</li>
<li>Add or remove groups of tasks from my agenda, or focus my
agenda/search on the current file,
</li>
<li>Simplify processing my weekly review (categorizing
accomplishments/tasks),
</li>
<li>Get a quick overview of important things, and
</li>
<li>Have file-specific options, like columns.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I often use <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs#agenda_commands">Org agenda custom commands</a> to jump around. For example,
one agenda command lists projects, and pressing RET on an agenda line
will take me to that project. I also use <code>org-capture</code> to take a note
from anywhere, and I use <code>org-goto</code> to navigate my files. For finding
specific files, I use <code>ido-find-file</code>. 
</p>

<p>
I use several Org Mode files. The five files below have a little more
than 1.3MB of text in total - tiny! - but they help me tremendously. I
also have lots of other Org files like my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs">Emacs configuration</a> and <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3968124/blog.html">my
blog index</a> (I often use Org for publishing), but these are my main
files.
</p>

<p>
<b>Personal tasks and notes: organizer.org</b>
</p>

<p>
This is the catch-all for any tasks or notes that don't belong to the
files below. Here's the rough structure:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Quick notes:</b> Tidbits that might not make it into their own blog
posts, but which can be included in weekly reviews
</li>
<li><b>Reference:</b> Hours, license keys, etc.
</li>
<li><b>Open loops:</b> Anything I need to check on every so often
</li>
<li><b>Projects:</b> High-level things I'm focusing on
</li>
<li><b>Financial goals:</b> Things to save up for
</li>
<li><b>Someday/maybe:</b> Projects to do someday
</li>
<li><b>Weekly review:</b> Divided by year
</li>
<li><b>Monthly review:</b> More summaries
</li>
<li><b>Plans:</b> Personal plans
</li>
<li><b>2011, 2012, 2013&#x2026;</b>: I use org-capture to quickly jot down notes.
The datetree option automatically files them by day, which makes
older ones easier to archive.
</li>
<li><b>Tasks:</b> A bucket for miscellaneous tasks
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Anything to do with business: business.org</b>
</p>

<p>
I organize these by the types of tasks I focus on and the notes I
want to keep.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Earn
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Clients
</li>
<li>Leads
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Projects

<li>Research
</li>
<li>Business ideas
</li>
<li>Blog
</li>
<li>Delegation

<li>Planning

</li>
<li>Hangouts
</li>
<li>Other
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reference
</li>
<li>Tasks
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>people.org</b>
</p>

<p>
I organize these by relationships so that I can remember who's out
there.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Family
</li>
<li>Extended family
</li>
<li>Canada friends
</li>
<li>Hacklab
</li>
<li>Barkada
</li>
<li>Letters
</li>
<li>Meetups
</li>
<li>Bloggers
</li>
<li>Family friends
</li>
<li>Other tasks
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>routines.org</b>
</p>

<p>
I organize these by frequency and omit the tasks from my weekly
review. This also contains my "In case of&#x2026;" scenarios and my backup
documentation.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every day
</li>
<li>Once a week
</li>
<li>Once a month
</li>
<li>Once a quarter
</li>
<li>Once a year
</li>
<li>When&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b><a href="http://sach.ac/outline">sharing/index.org</a></b>
</p>

<p>
I organize this by topic. See <a href="http://sach.ac/outline">http://sach.ac/outline</a> for the
published version!
</p>

<p>
<b>decisions.org</b>
</p>

<p>
I organize these by status. I also use org-choose markers (ex:
CHOSEN, MAYBE) inside the categories, but the headings make it easier
to review.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Pending
</li>
<li>Current
</li>
<li>For review
</li>
<li>Someday / maybe
</li>
<li>Archive
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>How do you organize your Org files?</b>
</p>

<p>
Everyone's got different ways of organizing outlines, and people also
also change over time. How do you organize yours?

I would love to be able to write all of my blog posts within Emacs. I like the outline tools and simple markup of <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a>. Org Mode and org2blog are invaluable when I'm writing a post with lots of code or keyboard commands, because it's easy to set up syntax highlighting or add teletype text. <a href="http://www.pablumfication.co.uk/2012/01/15/blog-posting-with-emacs-using-org2blog/">Here's an interesting self-referential example of org2blog's power</a> - using <code>#INCLUDE</code> to include the Org blog post source in the post itself.
</p>

<p>
If I expect that a post will have lots of images, I tend to use Windows Live Writer because it takes care of resizing and aligning images, linking to the original size. Because it uses my blog's stylesheet, I can get a sense of how the text will flow around it. I can quickly draw an idea in Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, copy and paste it into Windows Live Writer, and then resize it until it feels balanced on the page. Sometimes I draft a post in Emacs and then open it in Windows Live Writer or ScribeFire so that I can add images. 
</p>

<p>
Org Mode also supports images, but it's not as easy to resize things there. If I wrote a function that used ImageMagick to save the clipboard image to a file, resize it to the appropriate dimensions, and link it to the full-size image, maybe that would do the trick. Still, that sounds like it would be a fair bit of work. Maybe someday. Hmm - any chance someone reading this blog happens to already have that snippet handy? =)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
I screwed up my self-hosted Wordpress blog three ways in one evening.
</p>

<p>
First, I had an infinite loop thanks to Display Post Shortcode and <code>include_content</code> in a post that had the same tag that I was looking for. Right. Don't do that. Remember to remove <code>include_content</code> or exclude the post right before publishing.
</p>

<p>
Then I published a post without checking <i>several times</i> that my site was still up. I checked twice, which was apparently not enough. I should probably check five times. Or ten. Or at least a few times after restarting PHP. Since I hadn't checked, I spent a couple of hours playing a video game with W- instead of, say, stressing out about my site. Could've solved the problem sooner.
</p>

<p>
And then when I stressed out about my site, I "fixed it" in entirely the wrong way. I <i>reduced</i> <code>php5-fpm</code>'s <code>max_children</code> instead of increasing it. This made it worse.
</p>

<p>
I had been worrying about running out of memory when I should've been worrying about running out of processes.
</p>

<p>
I felt that panic-induced haze setting in, scrambling through Google and adding all sorts of bits to my config, ripping out all sorts of plugins, and wondering how I could get a coredump. When I noticed I was making things worse, I made myself stop. I took a deep breath, and started untangling what was going on. I tried the opposite of what I had been trying. That worked.
</p>

<p>
Good timing, actually. Well, it could have been better timing, but that's one of the nice things about minimizing commitments and making good stuff for free; it lowers the risk of trying things out and learning something new.
</p>

<p>
I'm still getting SIGSEGV errors. It happens even if there are few active server processes. But at least it's sporadic instead of constant, and 1:59 AM is not the best time to dig into something like that. After sleep and reading, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
I'm a little bit nervous about my setup, and I'll probably set aside some time this week to dig into system administration and build my skills. I really should have a good plan for downtime, and a better plan for learning the essentials outside of a fire. But mistakes are great because they show you multiple holes in your system, so this is not too bad. Better now than when I'm managing a client site.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, I did have the presence of mind to temporarily redirect sach.ac to the static URL, switching it back after the PHP issues seemed to have cleared. Good strategy. Should do that first in the future.
</p>

<p>
With any luck, the blog is still up today. If you're reading this, yay!
</p>

<p>
I'm still happy that I self-host, even if I make mistakes like this. =) Good time to make mistakes and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
So, what am I going to change for next time?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prepare a contingency plan for Stuff Happening, possibly involving throwing up a quick maintenance page that collects e-mails so that I can send abject apologies and link updates. Make this static so that it loads quickly, and have an external copy (ex: Dropbox) just in case my server is down and I have to redirect at the domain level.
</li>
<li>Check several times after restarting PHP. Just because it loads once doesn't mean it's going to load again.
</li>
<li>Consider redirecting URLs to static sketchnotes or external pages. Links and comments are nice, but viewing is essential.
</li>
<li>Start <code>screen</code> right away instead of trying to juggle different commands. Set up logs and go to different configuration directories in order to minimize typing.
</li>
<li>Don't panic. Yes, website failures are embarrassing, but the nice thing about making this a gift is that I don't have to worry about racking up the business losses. When I notice that I'm panicking (making wild guesses in terms of changes, for example), I should slow down and remind myself that This Is Not The End of The World.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everything's going to be all right.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
We have a computer downstairs with backups of files, and I've been using it to explore Vagrant and development using virtual machines as well. It can be useful to be able to SSH into it from outside our network, so I spent some time setting up a dynamic domain name, port forwarding, and new limits for the SSH server.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> (the domain name registrar that I use) supports dynamic domains, so it was easy to enable.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Enable dynamic domains: <b>Manage Domains</b>, choose the domain, and then choose <b>Dynamic DNS</b>. Enable it and copy the password.
</li>
<li>Create an A record: Choose <b>All Records</b> and add a subdomain with a temporary address (ex: 127.0.0.1) and type <b>A</b>. Save the settings.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Our router uses the <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato firmware</a>, which has built-in support for Namecheap and other dynamic DNS provider.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Click on <b>Basic</b> - <b>DDNS</b>.
</li>
<li>Fill in the details for <b>Dynamic DNS 1</b>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Before I forwarded the ports, I wanted to make sure that SSH permitted password authentication on our local network but required passphrases for external connections. <a href="http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/818">OpenSSH: requiring keys, but allow passwords from some locations</a> (Michael W. Lucas) was really helpful. I edited <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, set <code>PasswordAuthentication no</code>, and added the following lines to the end of the file:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Match Address 192.168.0.0/16
  PasswordAuthentication yes
</pre>

<p>
(I had some problems in the beginning because I typed this as <code>Yes</code> instead of <code>yes</code>&#x2026; Case matters!)
</p>

<p>
I restarted the SSH server with <code>service ssh restart</code> and confirmed that I could still SSH in. 
</p>

<p>
Back to Tomato. <b>Port Forwarding</b> lets you set up forwarding rules. The port for SSH is 22, so I filled in a row with the port I wanted, the internal port, and the internal IP address of the server. I clicked <b>Save</b> (forgot to do this a few times because the button was near the end of the page) and that was that.
</p>

<p>
On Windows, I walked W- through generating a DSA public key with <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuttyGEN</a>, loading it in <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">Pageant</a>, and copying it to his <code>.ssh/authorized_keys2</code> file.
</p>

<p>
Posting this here because I'm probably going to want to do this again someday, and it took some searching around. Besides, someone might find it handy!

I've been thinking about <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/08/thinking-about-how-to-type-faster/">how to type faster than 110wpm</a>, and digging
into the specific factors that I could improve. In particular, I
wanted to get a sense of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>my theoretical top speed
</li>
<li>whether alternates or rolls are better for me
</li>
<li>how quickly I can twitch, measured by single-key repeats or two-key alternations
</li>
</ul>

<p>
By using totally artificial typing tests (ex: type "thththth&#x2026;") instead of word-based ones, I can explore the relationships between character combinations and speed without worrying about hitting SPC, sounding out words, correcting errors, and so on. Since I can do the tests in short sprints, I can rest enough in between to minimize my risk of RSI.
</p>

<h3>Using Emacs to test my typing speed<h3>

<p>
I haven't come across an online typing test that gives the kind of
stats I want, or even a per-character or digram breakdown. I thought
about writing a Javascript-based typing timer, but I figured it would
be less work to cajole Emacs into measuring what I wanted.
</p>

<p>
Here's the code:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">sacha/timer-go</span> ()
  <span class="org-doc">"Quick keyboard timer."</span>
  (interactive)
  (insert <span class="org-string">"GO\n"</span>)
  (run-with-timer 3 nil (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> () (insert <span class="org-string">"\n"</span>)))  <span class="org-comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="org-comment">for warmup</span>
  (run-with-timer 15 nil (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> () <span class="org-comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="org-comment">12 seconds + the 3-second warmup</span>
                           (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((col (- (point) (line-beginning-position))))
                             (insert (format <span class="org-string">" | %d | \n"</span> col)))
                           )))
(local-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"&lt;f7&gt;"</span>) 'sacha/timer-go)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This prints "GO" to show you that it's running. You have three seconds to warm up, so you don't have to worry about wasting any milliseconds after <code>M-x sacha/timer-go</code> (or <code>F7</code>, the keyboard shortcut I bound mine to). After the warmup, Emacs adds a newline and the "race" is on. There's a 12 second period of actual typing, and then Emacs adds the number of characters you typed. When you see that, you can stop.
</p>

<p>
Twelve seconds is a useful number for estimating typing speed because the conversion from characters per minute (CPM) to words per minute (WPM) usually uses a factor of 5: CPM / 5 = WPM. So the number of characters you can type in <code>60 seconds / 5</code> is probably the number of "words" you could type in a minute. Testing your speed on trivial patterns (ex: 
ththththththththth)
</p>

<p>
Note: L and R refer to left and right hand. I've also numbered the fingers with 1 being the thumb and 5 being the pinky. The patterns I used are based on a Dvorak keyboard, but that doesn't matter as much. Just figure out what the equivalent patterns are on your preferred keyboard layout.
</p>

<p>
Limitations: I didn't do any special calculations to deal with errors (there were many doubling or transposition errors multi-character sequences), so the actual CPM will be lower. Also, repeated character sequences are definitely not normal and have quirks of their own. It's interesting to establish the range and see the kinds of errors that show up when I go faster than I'm comfortable with, though. 
</p>

<p>
If you don't care what you're typing, it's easy to type quickly. This is just about how fast my hands go if I don't have to think about which finger to activate. This mostly ended up as alternating left- and right-hand rolls (ex: aoeusntoahuesnto). Because I didn't have to precisely alternate, two-handed mashing resulted in more characters than one-handed mashing. Interestingly, my right hand is slightly faster than my left.

<p>
I expected rolls to be faster than alternates, but it turns out that alternating works out fine too ("the" and "and" on a Dvorak keyboard). Same-hand rolls had fewer errors than alternates, though - timing can be tricky when doing high-speed repeats. That can be partially handled by autocorrecting "teh" to "the" and similar transpositions. I use an AutoHotkey-based autocorrect script, but it screws up the typing tests I like, so I can't take advantage of it then. A roll-optimized keyboard layout might be more effective.
</p>

<p>
3- and 4-character rolls like the ones I tested aren't that common in actual typing, but it might be possible to find keyboard layouts that are better-optimized for the languages I use. I've read that Arensito, Capewell, and Colemak focus more on rolls and alternating rolls, so they might be worth a look.

Two-character patterns are slower than three-character patterns, probably indicating that there's a small delay as I think about repeating things. Alternates and same-hand two-character pairs seem to work okay. Even for same-hand two-character pairs, I get the occasional doubling or transposition error.

<p>
Single-finger keypresses (no automatic repeats) are slow. Good thing I don't have to do them that often. If this represents the speed at which I can send an impulse to my finger and have it do something, this might be a limiting factor for my typing speed, which is compensated for by alternates and rolls. 
</p>

<h3>Three characters with repositioning<h3>

<p>
Moving my fingers takes time too. Also, did you know that there are typing equivalents of tongue-twisters? I can't type "ranranranran&#x2026;" a long time without it turning into rna and other permutations. Maybe my brain gets hiccups.

<p>
Alternating hands is actually pretty tough if you have to care about
timing. Oddly, this is slower than repositioning. Maybe it's because
the repositioning helps me remember where I am in the word when I'm
repeating it, so natural typing will be a different case.
</p>

<h3>Wrap-up<h3>

<p>
Chunking seems to make a big difference for me. 4-character combinations tend to beat 3-character combinations and those tend to beat 2-character combinations, unless there's some timing involved. Common combinations (the, and) are easier to type. If I can get better at chunking words into syllables, that might help. The most common digraphs are
TH, HE, AN, IN, ER, ON, RE, ED, ND, HA, AT, EN, ES, OF, NT, EA, TI, TO, IO, LE, IS, OU, AR, AS, DE, RT, and VE (<a href="http://scottbryce.com/cryptograms/stats.htm">source</a>), so that might be good to look at next.
</p>

<p>
Twitching or moving individual fingers are slow operations, so being able to "look ahead" and move my fingers to the right spots while I'm typing the first few characters helps. Muscle memory also helps minimize errors.
</p>

<p>
Also, maybe finger dexterity and agility exercises?
</p>

<p>
I'm probably in the region of Diminishing Returns here. I could spend hours inching up my typing speed&#x2026; or I could spend that time doing other things. Now that I've identified specific areas to look into, though, I might be able to set up exercises to take advantage of interstitial time. For example, while I'm reading a book, I could do finger dexterity exercises (pausing, of course, if I feel any hint of strain - I'd like to avoid RSI if I can).
</p>

<p>
On another note, testing my theoretical speed in this way reminded me a little of how we used to play Decathlon on the computer as kids. (Was it <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/microsoft-decathlon/screenshots">Microsoft Decathlon</a>? The screenshots look familiar&#x2026;) Somehow our keyboard survived the rampage back then. =)

This outline is available at <a href="http://sach.ac/outline#transform-notes">http://sach.ac/outline#transform-notes</a>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>@gozes was curious about my workflow for transforming my notes and lessons learned into blog posts
</li>
<li>Many people struggle with this
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"I don't have time to blog."
</li>
<li>"No one will read it, so it's not worth it."  
</li>
<li>"I'm not an expert."
</li>
<li>"Knowledge is power."
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The time I take to share what I learn is the most valuable part of my learning process
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can spend three hours solving a technical problem or learning more about a skill, but the thing that makes it really worth it is the 30 minutes I spend writing about what I learned.
</li>
<li>If I don't write it down, I forget. I waste that time. If I don't publish it, I'm probably going to lose it.
</li>
<li>More subtle benefit: I <i>think</i> I know something, but when I try to explain it to other people, I discover the holes. Even if it's obscure and I think no one else will find it useful. (The Internet being the Internet, surprisingly, people do.)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing helps me relate what I learn to what I know.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sharing lets me help others, even if I'm not an expert.
</li>
<li>More selfishly, sharing helps me learn from others.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What and when
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I try to write a blog post as soon as possible instead of waiting until I can write a longer one
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One blog post answers one question or shares one thought - easier to link to, keeps it short, gets it out there
</li>
<li>I want to write down the details so that I can re-solve the problem if I run into it again
</li>
<li>or so that other people can learn (or at least ask follow-up questions)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Quick link if the post has already been written 
</li>
<li>Sometimes start with the question and then just write
</li>
<li>Usually start with rough outline or technical notes
</li>
<li>In terms of tools
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I really like Org Mode for Emacs because of its great outlining support
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Plain text, so I can trust it
</li>
<li>I can collapse or expand parts of my outline
</li>
<li>I can organize my post ideas into a larger outline
</li>
<li>I can export to HTML and share it with others
</li>
<li>And it supports TODOs and integrates with my other tasks, so I can set deadlines, track TODO states, or even clock in/out to see how long something takes&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So I have this detailed outline
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the sections and paragraphs are there, and I often include the points I want to make inside the paragraphs as well
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/sachac/status/380763070382866432">@gozes</a> was curious about my workflow for transforming my notes and lessons learned into blog posts.
</p>

<h3>Why it's worth taking the time to share</h3>

<p>
Many people struggle with sharing what they know. "I don't have time to blog." "No one will read it anyway, so why bother." "I'm not an expert." "Knowledge is power, so I should keep it to myself - job security!"
</p>

<p>
Let me tell you this: <b>The time I take to share what I learn is the most valuable part of my learning process.</b>
</p>

<p>
I can spend three hours solving a technical problem or learning more about a skill, but the thing that makes it really worth it is the 30 minutes I spend writing about what I learned. The biggest benefit is being able to refer back to my notes. If I don't write it down, I forget, and I've wasted the time spent learning. <i>If I don't publish my notes, I'm probably going to lose them</i>. It makes sense to invest a little time now so that I can save time later. I can't tell you how many times I've searched for something and ended up at a blog post I'd completely forgotten I'd written.
</p>

<p>
There's a more subtle benefit, too: <b>Explaining things to other people exposes holes in my understanding.</b> It's easy to think that I know something. When I start writing about it, though, I stumble across things I don't quite know how to explain. Filling in those gaps helps me learn even more. Even if I think no one's going to find my explanation useful because I'm working on something so quirky or obscure, the process of explanation helps. (And the Internet being the Internet, I'm often surprised by people who turn out to be working on similar things.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Sharing lets me help other people, even if I'm not an expert.</b> In fact, the best time to write is when you're a beginner, because you run into all the things that other people take for granted. More selfishly, sharing helps me learn from other people. People ask questions that help me learn more. They point out where I've made mistakes. They share better ways to do things. And because we’re building these connections, they also pass along professional and personal opportunities. Sharing is an excellent way to learn and grow.
</p>

<h3>When and what to write</h3>

<p>
<b>Write early, write often. Don't wait until you've figured everything out.</b> I try to write a blog post as soon as possible instead of waiting until I can write a more comprehensive one. I try to keep my blog post focused on answering a single question or sharing one thought. This makes the post easier to link to, keeps it (relatively) short, and gets rid of any excuse that would let me procrastinate putting it out there. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Write enough to help you remember.</b> When I write posts, I want to include enough details so that I can re-solve the problem if I run into it again, place myself back into the situation if I'm reflecting on how things worked out, or share what I've learned so that other people can figure things out (or at least ask follow-up questions). I don't need to answer everything. Sometimes I'll skip explaining things because people can always ask me to go deeper if they're interested. You don't have to write a complete guidebook to everything, you just have to add more guideposts to the trail.
</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>
<b>I love it when other people have already done the hard work of writing something up.</b> Then I can just link to what they've said, adding some thoughts of my own. If I can't find a great explanation within the first few pages of a web search&#x2013;or if I want to dig into something myself so that I understand it better&#x2013;then I write my own post.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sometimes I can start with just a question and then I go from there.</b> I write paragraph after paragraph as if I was e-mailing someone the answer or talking to them in person. I jump around here and there to edit the text or add links. I write quickly, and then I post.
</p>

<p>
<b>Most times, I start with a rough outline or my technical notes.</b> When I explore something I want to learn, I jump around an outline, gradually filling it in with what I come across. When I research, troubleshoot, or try to figure something out, I copy links and ideas into my notes. I've learned that it can be difficult to backtrack your steps to remember the things you tried, or remember the resources that were particularly helpful. It's better to take notes and update them along the way, even if you find yourself sometimes going down dead ends. 
</p>

<p>
<b>In terms of tools, I really like <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org mode for Emacs</a> because of its great outlining support.</b> My notes are in plain text, so I can search or work with my notes easily. I can collapse or expand parts of my outline, and I can easily reorganize items. I can organize my post ideas into a larger outline. I can export to HTML and share it with others, like I did with the outline for this post. My outline also supports TODOs and integrates with my other tasks, so I can set deadlines, track TODO states, or even clock in/out to see how long something takes.
</p>

<p>
<b>When I'm happy with the outline, I start turning it into text.</b> I write detailed outlines that include sections and the key points I want to make in paragraphs. (If you're curious, the outline for this post can be found at <a href="http://sach.ac/outline#transform-notes">http://sach.ac/outline#transform-notes</a> .) When I'm happy with how the outline flows, I copy the outline and start transforming it into my blog post. It's much less intimidating than working with a blank page, and I don't have to flip back and forth between my outline and my blog post editor. Working with an outline gives me an overview of where I want to go with the post, and it can also hold my thoughts when I go on tangents.
</p>

<p>
<b>The outline doesn't always completely translate into the blog post, of course.</b> Sometimes I cut out snippets and stash them in a different place in my larger outline, for use in a future blog post. Sometimes I move things around, or add more explanations to glue paragraphs together. I sometimes have a temporary title, but I usually don't know what the title could be until I've written the post.
</p>

<p>
<b>When I'm ready to post the entry, I add categories and sometimes tags to make posts easier to discover</b>. See <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/09/when-i-blog-with-emacs-and-when-i-blog-with-something-else/">When I blog with Emacs and when I blog with something else</a> for a more detailed discussion of the tools I use for publishing. I often add images because that's good practice for developing my visual vocabulary, either drawing stick figures or picking stock photos. Besides, the images break up otherwise-intimidating text.
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm learning a lot, but I don't want to overwhelm people, so I try to keep it to at most one post a day.</b> (Although sometimes I get excited and post anyway.) I schedule blog posts using the Editorial Calendar plugin for Wordpress, and I use the Share A Draft plugin to give people a sneak preview. This lets me answer people's questions with links to future blog posts. That way, they get the info they want, and everyone else will get it eventually.
</p>

<p>
<b>Writing about what I learned and reading people's feedback often gives me plenty of follow-up ideas.</b> I put those ideas back into my outline or TODO list, and the cycle continues.
</p>

<h3>How I'm working on getting better (continuous improvement for the win!)</h3>

<p>
I really like the way sharing helps me learn more effectively, and I want to get even better at it. Here are some things that I think will help:
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm working on getting better at tweaking the structure of my posts before writing them.</b> As in programming, it makes sense to fix logical errors or flow issues earlier rather than later. Working with outlines can help me get better at thinking in terms of questions and the flow from one point to another, and it's much easier to see and reorganize things there than when everything's written up.
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm working on making posts more "scannable" with illustrations, headings, and emphasis.</b> One of the tips I picked up from Beyond Bullet Points is that when designing presentations, your slide titles should make sense in sequence. I remember reading similar advice applied to writing. Paragraphs should also make sense when you're quickly scanning the starting sentences, and people who want more detail can read the rest of the paragraph or section. I've still got a long way to go here, but I think I'm getting better.
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm working on organizing higher-level outlines.</b> I'm getting more used to with outlining individual blog posts. The next step is to be able to explore and organize larger topics so that I can guide people through a series of chunks, perhaps with blog posts series or e-books. This will also help me plan my learning and build resources that guide people step by step.
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm curious about delegation or outsourcing, but I haven't really made the jump yet.</b> Would it be worth learning how to work with other people to flesh out these blog posts? For example, working with an editor might help me find ways to make these posts clearer, more concise, or more approachable. Can article writers or blog researchers add other perspectives or resources to these posts so that we're learning from more people's experiences, not just mine? I have to work through a couple of my concerns before I can make the most of this, but I think it might be worth exploring.

<li>I've been curious about task-based outsourcing like Fiverr.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Quick "hire", low commitment

</ul>
</li>
<li>What are my goals?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn more effectively
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The limiting factor is not the lack of articles or reading material

<li>Take advantage of other people's perspectives

<li>Find resources I might not have come across myself, or that I don't have time to look for
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep things going even if I'm not paying active attention to them
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Momentum
</li>
<li>For example, while I'm consulting

<li>Well, I'm not going to learn how to choose until I choose.

</li>
<li>I'm worried that I don't know how to specify the work that I want. I'm worried that there'll be a mismatch of expectations. I want clear, non-self-promotional, useful articles, and the provider might think I want some search-engine optimizing fluff.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can work on being clear and providing examples. Besides, getting what I <span class="underline">don't</span> want teaches me how to specify what I do.

<li>I'm worried that it will be inauthentic.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Always personalize

based on the titles alone.

<li>Huh. This could be harder than I thought, because I'm not that
happy with the resources that are out there. Maybe I should
figure out a better strategy.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm thinking of investing more in my blog, maybe experimenting with.
</li>
<li>NOT
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>having someone "spin" keyword-laden content for me
</li>
<li>someone to keep me accountable re: writing - it's already a habit =)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want to get better at writing
</li>
<li>One way: Identify and deliberately practice <i>blogging skills</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Current focus areas
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Outlining (mostly comfortable; need to get to the point of calibrating outline to ~100 words?)
</li>
<li>Synthesizing information (lists, etc.), bringing everything together with a conclusion or recommendations
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next steps
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write better headlines 
</li>
<li>End strong: conclusion, call to action, question
</li>
<li>Start strong: improve first paragraph
</li>
<li>Pick better post topics (research, feedback, etc.)
</li>
<li>Get into the habit of sending newsletter e-mail, maybe for upcoming blog posts
</li>
<li>Get into the habit of updating, organizing, and packaging information resources
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Doing this, having fun, making progress.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hmm, might be interesting to think about how to measure this progress
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another way: coaching
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ideally, someone with better skills
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Model excellence and call their shots
</li>
<li>Give feedback on gaps
</li>
<li>Help me teach others
</li>
<li>Ideal scenario?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We pick a skill to focus on, like synthesizing information
</li>
<li>They recommend some of their favourite role models
</li>
<li>We come up with exercises or challenges (I'm currently listify-ing at least one post per week; ditto stock photos)
</li>
<li>(We might be able to skip the research part for now, as that's time-consuming and lower-value than planning/editing.)
</li>
<li>They help me improve the logical organization of the outline
</li>
<li>They help me improve the transitions and organization of the draft post
</li>
<li>We brainstorm better headlines and calls to action / questions for the audience
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Also, related Twitter post?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even a different perspective is useful
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Check whether something makes sense
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I don't care about typos if the meaning stays the same
</li>
<li>I care about good headlines and saying clear, useful, time-saving, non-obvious things
</li>
<li>I care about explaining things that people might find confusing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I might write a blog post for an advanced audience, but it would be good to flag what needs to be explained for intermediate audiences etc. and then fill that in with blog posts later on
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How to map this out?  
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I care about tightening things up and making transitions smooth
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need more precise feedback than "It doesn't work." I want to see alternatives.
</li>
<li>Learning how to put my editing hat on
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brainstorming/planning stage?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Outline, notes, quotes, examples, questions
</li>
<li>Follow-up blog posts
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also possibly useful: research and editing help
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People will search using different keywords and sources than I might
</li>
<li>Good for prioritizing lots of resources
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Value depends
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do I read faster than they do? Can I filter through resources faster?
</li>
<li>Do they have similar or better prioritization functions? Am I wowed by their choices?
</li>
<li>Comparative advantage?  
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the following the ideal scenario for that? This is some time in the future, though, after I get used to working with other people while writing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I send the person an outline and some notes, and he or she
sends back summaries of the best resources with citations
and links. I add personal stories (this comes after research
because I want to apply advice and it's better than just
searching for confirmatory evidence) and publish.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good for editing transcripts and misc. documents too, possibly handling some of the regular publishing (ex: sketchnotes or updates)?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Process tips? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tools and processes are harder to transfer
</li>
<li>Metacognition?  
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good to have a safety net: at some point, I anticipate being more frazzled. This is part of life.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I could do what other people do and <span class="underline">not</span> blog, but it's more fun to learn from the conversation.
</li>
<li>Good to have someone doublecheck that I'm making sense
</li>
<li>Make sure that I'm writing useful stuff instead of focusing too much on my life
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes, it's a personal blog, but I may as well be useful at the same time =)
</li>
<li>And also check that I'm not <i>too</i> impersonal, because that would be boring
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do some of that research, maybe?
</li>
<li>Investment in ongoing learning and connection
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>May need to prioritize
</li>
<li>or may just need to learn how to put my editing hat on
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Justifying value
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Competing options
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Options
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do it myself
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm doing pretty well
</li>
<li>Lots of great tips out there
</li>
<li>I'm nowhere near the limit of what I can learn for free or from experience
</li>
<li>Use books and role models for passive guidance
</li>

</li>
<li>Learn from people's feedback
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is great! People comment and share
</li>
</ul>

<li>Find or start a blogging mastermind group
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Group insight, more perspectives

<li>Ex: reorganizing the logic of a piece and explaining why, instead of making tiny word changes (remove "just", etc. - useful, but not as useful as the other kind of feedback)
</li>

<li>Sell information products or courses, maybe on a pay-what-you-can basis

<li>Use as a regular weekly sanity-check for batch processing

<li>biking, raking, turning compost, carrying water
</li>
<li>coding
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>doing more Emacs coding and other tech stuff (Node, Python, Ruby, CSS3)
</li>
<li>why: because I can build stuff (and more importantly, <span class="underline">imagine</span> cool stuff)
</li>
<li>wild success: I can come up with ideas and make tools
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>for example, this little beeminder.el thing
</li>
<li>I want to get better at making web tools that are useful and that look good
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>do I really? lots of people out there can do this
</li>
<li>and I haven't really come up with ideas that need this yet
</li>
<li>back to the lack of imagination!
</li>
<li>wait until I have a stronger idea? learn so that I can get ideas?
</li>
<li>hmm, integration with APIs

<li>warning: digital sharecropping; even more transient than trusting my data elsewhere. TOBLOG: 10 years of blogging, trust that things will be around

<li>let's investigate some possible futures

<li>lots of little tools for niche audiences
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>role models: technomancy, johnw,

<li>one big tool with a community behind it
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>role models: carsten, bastien, matt mullenweg
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hmm. I like working with Emacs more than I like working with the web.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>maybe I'll dig into backend things instead (clojure? node?) if I need to maintain a path back into the workforce
</li>
<li>I like talking to fellow geeks anyway, so it's okay if I don't focus on front end (and I won't have to deal with fiddly browser differences or client tweaks)

</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>writing 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>why: because I learn and understand things, and because it saves other people time / tickles other people's brains
</li>
<li>what about?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>things that are not already thoroughly covered elsewhere
</li>
<li>geeky and approachable
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>what's on the backburner for now?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>sketchnoting other people's content

<li>yes, it's useful and easy to appreciate
</li>
<li>I may make an exception for books, since I like reading anyway.
</li>

</li>
<li>spreading sketchnoting
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mike Rohde, Sunni Brown, and Dan Roam are taking good care of this
</li>
<li>I can focus on showing by doing

</ul>
</li>
<li>spreading the idea of alternative lifestyles (semi-retirement, portfolio careers, etc.)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Jeff Goins, Pamela Slim, and Mr. Money Mustache are doing fine with this
</li>
<li>I don't want to inadvertently feed wantrepreneurship 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>spreading blogging in general
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>might make an exception for tech blogging, because I have a vested interest in getting more geeks to blog ;)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>drawing better
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What I understand about what drives me
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I like the feeling of figuring things out and of contributing to something that will build over time
</li>
<li>I like positive feedback, but I can move away from it if I want
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ex: lots of people want more sketchnotes, but I like Emacs stuff more
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I don't have a particularly strong idea for something I want to build, I:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>learn more about the capabilities of the tools I use
</li>
<li>fill in small gaps along the way
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some examples of past ideas
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advertising on back of laptop: Quickly implemented for experiment, done.
</li>
<li>SketchnoteIndex: Built, populated; shelved as my interest had moved on
</li>
<li>Visual vocabulary: Populated; added to sporadically
</li>
<li>Quantified Awesome: Built, populated; continue adding to
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I tend to build things for my own convenience. I open it up if I think a web interface will be handy, and if other people find it helpful, yay

The point of scenario planning, after all, is not to be right, which
is such a human inclination that we find it hard to overcome—the point
of scenario planning is to see the future from perspectives we would
have a difficult time forcing ourselves to imagine because of our bias
toward rightness, and therefore imagine new possibilities or see
threats we might otherwise miss.
The trick is to know we will always be wrong as we speculate about the
future

Yet, the purpose of scenario planning is not to pinpoint future events
but to highlight large-scale forces that push the future in different
directions. It's about making these forces visible, so that if they do
happen, the planner will at least recognize them. It's about helping
make better decisions today.

It's been a little over half a year since I <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/02/decision-update-hacklab-to/">signed up for a membership at HackLab</a>, a makerspace and coworking area in Kensington Market. 
Before I signed up, I thought about the things I would like to be true at the evaluation point for my experiment, which I set at nine months after I signed up (so November 2013). I figured it would be good to do a quick check so that I can adjust things. Here's what I wrote in February, and how it has matched up so far with my experience:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>I know more about other geeks in Toronto thanks to ambient conversations and helping each other out</dt><dd>HackLab is full of interesting people. I like dropping by and hanging out at the open houses or during regular days.
</dd>
<dt>I’m better at asking people for help when I get stuck, and at setting myself tougher challenges knowing that people can help</dt><dd>I've done this a couple of times (keyboard layouts, business questions, web stuff, system administration), although I still need to work on that.
</dd>
<dt>I’ve dug into some of the more difficult things that are easier to learn with other people who can help me. For example: web development, mobile development, electronics</dt><dd>Web development and system administration might be good things to focus on. There are lots f other people who are working on similar things.
</dd>
<dt>I’ve gotten better at sketching ideas, asking other people for feedback, and fleshing out the ones that get people interested</dt><dd>I drew How to Learn Emacs while I was at HackLab. That was fun. =) I've drawn some of the sketchnote lessons here, too. 
</dd>
<dt>I’ve improved serendipity (test different laptop cues to talk? talk to people about what they’re working on?)</dt><dd>Overhearing stuff works well.
</dd>
<dt>I go to HackLab 1-2 times a week, and sometimes more often if the weather is great.</dt><dd>See analysis below
</dd>
<dt>I’m good at managing my focus (do not disturb / yes, talk to me)</dt><dd>Background conversations interfere with things like typing practice (Plover/Colemak), but I'm okay with listening to conversations while typing (Dvorak), coding, or drawing. Headphones help a little.
</dd>
<dt>I’m good at talking to new people and hanging out with the regulars</dt><dd>Getting there. I feel comfortable around HackLab members and I often have interesting conversations at open houses, particularly over food.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In general, the benefits I'm looking for are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ambient socialization with interesting people
</li>
<li>Ambient exposure to interesting things
</li>
<li>Possible support for learning stuff (ex: Javascript, system administration, Haskell, Python, neural nets, hardware, electronics, 3D printing)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
My initial goal was to go to HackLab 1-2 times a week. As of 2013-09-25 (~31 weeks after I joined; I was doing this analysis before the members' meeting), I have been to HackLab on 41 distinct days. This is within my target range of 31 to 62 visits, and works out to 1.3 visits a week. This is a pleasant surprise, because I started this analysis thinking that I was underusing my HackLab membership compared to my goals. Based on my current attendance, this costs a little less than $10 per visit, which is worth the awesome vegan cooking opportunities / lessons / dinners (Tuesday open houses) and overheard conversations with interesting geeks.  
</p>

<p>
I'm at 66% of the top part of my goal range. What are my current limiting factors, and how can I work around them?
</p>

<p>
Inertia is powerful and works ways: when I'm home, it's easy to stay home; when I'm in the middle of working on something interesting on the kitchen table, I don't want to pack up and bike over. I often sleep in during my non-consulting days, and sometimes I think: "Is it really worth biking downtown for a few hours of hanging out or working?" I've also offered to do a couple of extra half-days of consulting each week during September and October, so that limits the number of days when it makes sense to go to HackLab. Besides, introvert mode is pretty comfortable - no distracting conversations, and plenty of good food in the fridge.
</p>

<p>
So, what could help me make even better use of HackLab? How can I hack my motivation and reward structure to get me out the door?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Commit to the exercise and treat HackLab as a bonus.</b> At least once a week (Fridays), I will bike for at least 1.5 hours including a mailbox check. I might as well use that biking time to end up at Hacklab, do some stuff, and then take the other 45 minutes on the way back.
</li>
<li><b>Make Hacklab the centre of my socialization.</b> Instead of setting up separate get-togethers with people, I will funnel people to HackLab's open house (which I will attend whenever I don't have other events). If I'm in introvert mode, I will treat the open house as cooking lessons, catch up with people briefly, and relax knowing that people can always chat with other people. If I'm in socialization mode, I will catch up with people.
</li>
<li><b>Consider small-scale cooking on regular days.</b> Have fun by cooking at HackLab even on non-open house days: merienda? This might be easier once we've moved to the new location, with a larger kitchen and a non-drinks fridge.
</li>
<li><b>On HackLab days, do not open the computer at home in the morning.</b> This gets around the momentum issue. Checking things on the phone is okay, as is working on the computer if something urgent comes up.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>What about winter?</b> I'm going to face some motivation challenges when snow makes biking more dangerous and the cold encourages me to stay home. On mild days in winter, I might be able to bike down or TTC down. I can use that as a context switch to write or code. Is it worth $6 to take the TTC down here at least once a week, bringing it to a total cost of $16 or so? Maybe, especially if I move things around so that I'm at HackLab instead of consulting on Tuesdays (or I work remotely on Tuesdays). If I discount winter and consider my membership based solely on my attendance so far, it works out to roughly $15 per day, which is still worth it considering other co-working spaces are $20 for a day pass and don't offer 24h access, not that I've been here at 3 AM. Besides, HackLab does cool things. So yes, I'll continue throughout winter, and I'll see if I can get past the activation costs of getting down here by TTC. (Reading time on the subway/streetcar, and travelling during off-peak hours?)
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, here are the queries that I used to check how many times I've been in HackLab:

<p>
In the process of experimenting with different types of businesses,
I've been learning a lot about different types of commitments. There's
a spectrum of commitment-hardness, from very hard (take a loss if you
have to, but Make This Happen) to very soft (it's nice to have, but no
big deal if it doesn't work out).
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a very hard commitment is speaking.</b> If I commit to
giving a talk at event, I need to prepare the talk, and I need to be
there. Doesn't matter if I have a cold. Doesn't matter if I'm running
late because of another meeting and have to hop into a cab. Doesn't
matter if I'm feeling out of it. I need to show up and be
professional, which means energy and connection. I can collapse
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a hard commitment is sketchnoting an event.</b> I promise
to be at the event on a certain date, and if I miss that, the
opportunity is gone forever. It's not as big a deal as speaking, since
sketchnoting is usually an extra. I write my agreements so that I'm
only responsible for refunding the client's payment if something falls
through instead of being liable for loss of business or other costs.
I've never had to invoke this clause, but I've turned down gigs because of uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a medium commitment is freelance development.</b> If I'm
working with other developers, then I usually need to work at specific
times or at a specific pace, but there's often some leeway in what I
can do and when.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conversations are also medium commitments.</b> They're scheduled in the
calendar, but we can reschedule if necessary. 
</p>

<p>
<b>An example of a softer commitment is illustration.</b> Someone is
counting on the images, and sometimes there's a deadline. I'm free to
do the work at a time of my choosing, though, aside from the
occasional meetings that are more like hard commitments.
</p>

<p>
<b>The kind of consulting I've settled into is another example of a soft
commitment.</b> I have a few meetings (usually mid-day or early
afternoon), but I have a lot of flexibility in terms of how many hours
I work each week. We keep a long, prioritized list of things to work
on, so I can usually choose what I want to work on at a particular
time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Writing is a very soft commitment.</b> No one cares when I do it, so I
can write whenever I want. I can write a whole bunch of posts in one
day and spread them out for consistency and variety. I can slowly
accumulate thoughts or resources for books. I care about writing at
least a little bit each week, but that push comes from me.
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough, compensation isn't always proportional to the hardness
of the commitment. Most of it has to do with the underlying skills
rather than how strict the commitment is.
</p>

<p>
I vastly prefer softer commitments over harder ones. Some of the
things I'm working on have unpredictable schedules, and I'd rather be
able to reschedule or move things around if something comes up. I
minimize the number of hard commitments (business or personal) I need
to plan for, and keep a stock of soft commitments that help me take
advantage of spare moments. Soft commitments make it easier to match
interest or energy with choice of activity, so it's easier to focus
and get things done.
</p>

<p>
I've been taking on fewer events, working on consulting and writing
instead. After all, if I can get away with it, why not work with less
stress and more happiness? =)

There's power in constant progress, even if it's small. You can motivate yourself in different ways. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem%22">Don't break the chain"</a> is a popular model: keep track of the days that you work on something, count the number of consecutive days in your current streak, and eventually it will build up into a number that you're proud of. If you miss a day, you start back at 0. This works for a lot of people, but it's a bit harsher than I'd like.

<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27180&shareadraft=baba27180_534ca8bd7fd1d">http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27180&shareadraft=baba27180_534ca8bd7fd1d</a>
</p>

<p>
With another Quantified Self Toronto meetup in a few weeks and a conversation with fellow self-trackers, it's time for me to think about time again. 
</p>

<p>
I've been fixing bugs and adding small pieces of functionality to <a href="http://quantifiedawesome.com">Quantified Awesome</a>, and I spent some time improving the integration with Emacs. Now I can type <code>!</code> to clock in on a task and update Quantified Awesome. Completing the task clocks me out in Emacs and updates Beeminder if appropriate. (I don't update Quantified Awesome when finishing a task, because I just clock into the next activity.) This allows me to take advantage of Org's clock reports for project and task-level time, at least for discretionary projects that involve my computer. I'm not going to get full coverage, but that's what Quantified Awesome's web interface is for. It takes very little effort to track things now, if I'm working off my to-do list. Even if I'm not, it still takes just a few taps on my phone to switch activities.
</p>

<p>
Most of my data is still medium-level, since I'm still getting the hang of sorting out my time in Emacs. Looking at data from 2014 so far, dropping partial weeks, and doing the analysis on April 14 (which is when I'm drafting this), here's what I've been finding.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I sleep a little more than I used to: an average of 8.9 hours a day, or 37% of the time. This is up from 8.3 hours last year. 
</li>
<li>It takes me about an hour to get ready in the mornings. If I have a quick breakfast instead of having rice and fried egg, I can get out the door in 30-45 minutes.
</li>
<li>It takes me 50-60 minutes to get downtown, whether this is by transit or bicycle. Commuting takes 3% of my time.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Little surprises:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I've spent almost twice as much time on business building or discretionary productive activities (19%) as I have earning (11%) - good to see <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/becoming-own-client/">decisions</a> in action! 
</li>
<li>I've spent more time drawing than writing this year (5% vs 3%). Next to writing, Emacs is the productive discretionary activity I spend most of my time on (2%).
</li>
<li>I've spent 10% of my time this year on connecting with people, a surprisingly high number for me. E-mail takes 1% of my overall time.
</li>
<li>It turns out that yes, coding and drawing are negatively correlated (-0.63 considering all coding-related activities). But writing and drawing are positively correlated (0.44), which makes sense - I draw, and then I write a blog post to glue sketches together and give context. Earning is slightly negatively correlated with building business/skills (-0.15), but connecting is even more negatively correlated with time spent building business/skills (-0.35). So it's probably not that consulting takes me away from building skills. Sleep is slightly negatively correlated with all records related to socializing (-0.14), but strongly negatively correlated with productive discretionary activities (-0.55). Hmm. Something to tinker with.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some things I'm learning from tracking time on specific tasks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Outlining doubles the time I take to write (and drops me from about ~30wpm to about 9wpm), but I feel that it makes things more structured.
</li>
<li>Drawing takes longer too, but it makes blog posts more interesting.
</li>
<li>Trying to dictate posts takes me way more time than outlining or typing it, since I'm not as used to organizing my thoughts that way.
</li>
<li>Encoding litter box data takes me about a minute per data point. So spending a lot of time trying to figure out computer vision and image processing in order to partially automate the process doesn't strictly make sense, but I'm doing it out of curiosity.
</li>
<li>I generally overestimate the time I need for programming-related tasks, which is surprising. That could just be me padding my estimates to account for distractions or to make myself feel great, though.
</li>
<li>I generally underestimate the time I need to write, especially if I'm figuring things out along the way.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This post took me 1:20 to draft (including data analysis), although to be fair, part of that involved a detour checking electricity use for an unrelated question. =)

</div><ul class="org-ul"><li>Session 1: The Whys and Hows of Tracking Time<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-4-9-1">
<p>
Discuss objectives and motivations for tracking time. Plan possible questions you want to ask of the data (which influences which tools to try and how to collect data). Recommend a set of tools based on people’s interests and context (paper? iPhone? Android? Google Calendar?).
Resources: Presentations on time-tracking, recommendations for tools, more detail on structuring data (categories, fields); possible e-mail campaign for reminders
Output: Planning worksheet for participants to help people remember their motivations and structure their data collection; habit triggers for focused, small-scale data collection, buddying up for people who prefer social accountability
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Session 2: Staying on the Wagon + Preliminary Analysis<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-4-9-2">
<p>
Checking in to see if people are tracking time the way they want to. Online and/or one-on-one check-ins before the workshop date, plus a group session on identifying and dealing with obstacles (because it helps to know that other people struggle and overcome these things). Preliminary analysis of small-scale data.
Resources: Frequently-encountered challenges and how to deal with them; resources on habit design; tool alternatives
Output: Things to try in order to support habit change; larger-scale data collection for people who are doing well
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Session 3: Analyzing your data<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-4-9-3">
<p>
Massaging your data to fit a common format; simple analyses and interpretation
Resources: Common analysis format and some sample charts/instructions; maybe even a web service?
Output: Yay, charts!
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Session 4: More ways you can slice and dice your data<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-4-9-4">
<p>
Bring other questions you’d like to ask, and we’ll show you how to extract that out of your data (if possible – and if not, what else you’ll probably need to collect going forward). Also, understanding and using basic statistics
Resources: Basic statistics, uncommon charts
Output: More analyses!
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Session 5: Making data part of the way you live<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-4-9-5">
<p>
Building a personal dashboard, integrating your time data into your decisions
Outcome: Be able to make day-to-day decisions using your time data; become comfortable doing ad-hoc queries to find out more
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Session 6: Designing your own experiments<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-4-9-6">

I've used Microsoft Excel's <code>SUMIF</code> function to conditionally add up
values before. For example, <code>SUMIF</code> is handy when you have a table of
use cases and you want to sum the points for all the use cases with
priority 1. <code>SUMIFS</code> (Microsoft Excel 2007 and later) is even more
powerful - it allows you to specify multiple criteria.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-5-1">
<p>
If you're like me, you probably have a to-do list several miles long. I like thinking of this as the backlog from agile programming. It's a list of tasks that I could choose to work on, but I haven't committed to doing everything on the list.
</p>

<p>
I tend to add tasks faster than I cross tasks out. (Hmm, I should track this!) This is okay. In fact, this is a good thing. It means that I'll always have a variety of tasks to choose from, which lets me choose good tasks.
</p>

<p>
People manage tasks in different ways. For my personal tasks, I use several large text files in Org Mode for Emacs. Org Mode is an outline-based tool, which makes it easy for me to organize my tasks into projects and projects into themes. It also supports tagging, links, agendas, dynamic views, and all sorts of other great ways to slice-and-dice my task list. Here's how I deal with some of the common challenges people face with a large task backlog:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Making sure important, urgent tasks don't fall through the cracks
</li>
<li>Making sure you don't neglect important but not urgent tasks
</li>
<li>Keeping track of what you're waiting for
</li>
<li>Catching procrastination
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li>Making sure important, urgent tasks don't fall through the cracks<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-1-1">
<p>
If something has a deadline, I add the deadline in Org using <code>C-x C-d</code> (<code>org-deadline</code>). This means that reminders will appear on my daily agenda for the 14 days before the deadline, counting down to the deadline itself. (The number of days is controlled by <code>org-deadline-warning-days</code>.) In addition, I usually schedule the task for a day that I want to work on it, so that I can get the task out of the way.
</p>

<p>
I'm careful about what I commit to, erring on the side of under-committing rather than over-committing. I'm selective about my client work and my volunteering. I keep my schedule as open as I can, and I'm not afraid to reschedule if I need to. Hardly anything I work on could be considered urgent. If an urgent request does come in, I ask questions to determine its true urgency, including potential alternatives and consequences of failure.
</p>

<p>
You might not have as much choice about what to work on, but you might also be surprised by how much you can push back. Be careful about what you allow to be urgent in your life.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>Making sure you don't neglect important but not urgent tasks<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-1-2">
<p>
I have plenty of space to work on things that are important but not urgent because I manage my commitments carefully. This means that I can usually finish a few important-but-not-urgent tasks every day.
</p>

<p>
Which tasks do I consider important? I like thinking in terms of projects. Important tasks tend to be associated with projects instead of standing in isolation. Important tasks move me toward a specific goal. I have <a href="http://sachachua.com/evil-plans">many goals and projects</a>, but because they're fewer than the number of tasks I have, I can prioritize them more easily. I can decide that some projects are in the background and some are in focus. Important tasks are the tasks that help me make more progress on the projects I consider important.
</p>

<p>
Because I like having two or three projects on the go, it helps to make sure that I make regular progress on those projects instead of getting carried away on just one. Tracking my time helps me stay aware of that balance. I also review my projects every week and schedule specific tasks for each of them, so I can make a little progress at least. Once I switch context and start thinking about a project, it's easy to pick another couple of tasks in that area and get even more done.
</p>

<p>
If you're struggling with creating enough space to work on important but not urgent tasks, you might be able to partner up with someone so that you can block off time to work on non-urgent things. Many teams have a rotating schedule for dealing with customer requests or urgent issues. One person covers the requests for a day, allowing the rest of the team to focus. Then the next person takes on that duty, and so on.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>Keeping track of what you're waiting for<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-1-3">
<p>
One of the useful tips I picked up from David Allen's Getting Things Done book was the idea of marking a task as WAITING. I usually add a description of what I'm waiting for, who's responsible, and when I want to follow up. This makes it easier to follow up. When I'm waiting for a specific date (ex: the library makes a DVD hold-able after a certain date), I schedule the task for then.
</p>

<p>
I use the <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Boomerang for Gmail</a> extension when I'm waiting for an e-mail reply. Boomerang lets me pop the message back into my inbox if I haven't received a reply by a specific date, so I don't have to keep track of that myself.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>Handling less-important but still useful things<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-1-4">
<p>
There are tasks on my to-do list that have been on that list for years. This is okay. 
I'm getting better at noting names and contact information in my tasks so that I can follow up with people even after some time. This is particularly useful for book recommendations. I get a lot of book recommendations and I get most of my books from the library, so there's usually a delay of a few weeks. Because Org Mode lets me add notes and links to the body of a task, I can look up information easily.
</p>

<p>
I work on less-important tasks when I don't feel like working on my major tasks, or when I'm looking for small tasks so I can fill in the gaps of my day. Org Mode gives me plenty of ways to look up tasks. I usually look for tasks by projects, navigating through my outline. I can also look for tasks by effort estimate, so I can see everything that will probably take me less than 15 minutes. Context is useful too - I can search for various tags to find tasks I can do while I'm on the phone, or out on errands, or when I feel like writing or drawing.
</p>

<p>
I like thinking in terms of low-hanging fruit, so I often choose tasks that require little time or effort and have good impact. It can be overwhelming to look at a long list of tasks and decide which ones have good return. It's easier to tag these tasks when you create the task, or to think in terms of projects instead.
</p>

<p>
Some tasks grow in importance or urgency over time. If I want to make sure that I revisit a task on a certain date, I schedule it for then.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>Catching procrastination<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-1-5">
<p>
I still end up scheduling tasks multiple times. (I've been putting off redoing my business cards for a few months now!) I've noticed that there are different kinds of procrastination, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Procrastinating because you don't have time today:</b> It's easy to reschedule things a few weeks or a month in advance. In fact, Org has a built-in command for bulk-scattering tasks. From the agenda view, you can type <code>m</code> to mark multiple tasks, then type <code>B</code> and then <code>S</code> to scatter tasks randomly over the next N days. (Call it with a prefix argument as <code>C-u B S</code> to limit it to weekdays.) If I catch myself procrastinating because I don't have enough time, that's usually a sign to be more cautious about my estimates and commitments, so I adjust those too.
</li>
<li><b>Procrastinating because it's less important than other tasks:</b> This is related to the time reason. I have no qualms about pushing less-important tasks forward.
</li>
<li><b>Procrastinating because you don't feel like working on it:</b> Is the task actually important? If it's not, I usually get rid of it without feeling guilty. If it's still useful, I might unschedule it so that I see it only if I'm looking for tasks in that project or in that context. Alternatively, I can just mark the task as CANCELLED or SOMEDAY. If the task is important, I think about whether I'm likely to feel like working on it at some point in the future. If I'm likely to not feel any different about it, I might delegate it, or I might just sit down and do it since procrastination doesn't add value. On the other hand, if I'm likely to feel like working on it at some point, then I tag it with that context and push it out to some other date.
</li>
<li><b>Procrastinating because you forgot about it:</b> I usually check my agenda every day and Org shows forgotten things in a different colour, so I catch these quickly. If the tasks are more important than the tasks I've already scheduled, I might work on those first. Alternatively, I might schedule it for sometime later.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I procrastinate based on my to-do list, not based on my inbox. The inbox is a terribly unstructured way to manage your tasks. I use Boomerang for Gmail to defer some mail to a later date, but that's usually so that I can pop it back into my inbox the day that I meet someone so that I have context and so that I don't have to copy the link into the calendar entry or my TO-DO list. 
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>Wrapping up<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-6-5-1-6">
<p>
So that's how I deal with having a large backlog. I focus first on the stuff that I need to do, and I make sure that shows up on my agenda. Then I make it easy to look for stuff that I want to do using Org's support for projects, tags, time estimates, and so on. I don't feel guilty about having lots of tasks to choose from. I view my backlog positively. It lets me do good stuff without worrying too much about how I spend my time.
</p>

<p>
How do you deal with your backlog? =)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-6-5-2">
<p>
It's been twelve years since David Allen published Getting Things Done, with its geek-friendly flowcharts and processes for handling tasks in an interrupt-driven life. The way I manage my tasks is heavily influenced by GTD. I think in terms of next actions, waiting, and someday, and I have weekly reviews. I modified the TODO states a little to reflect what I need. It's time to think about those states again to see what I can tweak and what reports I could use.
</p>

<p>
I use Org Mode in Emacs to manage my tasks and my notes. I can customize it to give me different kinds of reports, such as showing me all of my unscheduled tasks, or all tasks with a specific category, or even projects that are "stuck" (no next actions defined). Thinking about my processes will help me figure out what reports I want and how I want to use them.
</p>

<p>
Here are different types of tasks and how I track them:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Things I can work on right now (next actions): <code>TODO</code>
</li>
<li>Things that I can work on after a different task is finished: currently <code>WAITING</code>, but probably better to implement with org-depend
</li>
<li>Things I will revisit at a certain date, but I don't need to think about them until then: <code>TODO</code>, scheduled (I used to use <code>POSTPONED</code>)
</li>
<li>Things that would be nice to do someday, but maybe are incompletely specified or understood: <code>SOMEDAY</code>
</li>
<li>Things I have decided not to work on: <code>CANCELLED</code>
</li>
<li>Things I have asked someone else to do: <code>DELEGATED</code>
</li>
<li>Things I can ask someone else to do: <code>TODELEGATE</code>
</li>
<li>Things I am waiting for (usually not based on date) and that I need to follow up on: <code>WAITING</code>
</li>
<li>Things I can write about: <code>TOBLOG</code>. These are pretty optional, so I don't want them in my TODO list&#x2026;
</li>
<li>If something is a duplicate of something else - remove TODO keyword and add link?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I use the following code for an agenda view of unscheduled tasks:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">sacha/org-agenda-skip-scheduled</span> ()
  (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline 'regexp <span class="org-string">"\n]+&gt;"</span>))

(add-to-list 'org-agenda-custom-commands
   '(<span class="org-string">"u"</span> <span class="org-string">"Unscheduled tasks"</span> alltodo <span class="org-string">""</span>
     ((org-agenda-skip-function 'sacha/org-agenda-skip-scheduled)
     (org-agenda-overriding-header <span class="org-string">"Unscheduled TODO entries: "</span>))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So the to-do process looks like this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every week, review my <a href="http://sachachua.com/evil-plans">evil plans</a> and projects. Check my agenda without the routine tasks to see what new things I'm working on. Schedule a few tasks to encourage me to make regular progress.
</li>
<li>Every day, go through my Org agenda (<code>C-c a a</code>) and do all the tasks that are scheduled.
</li>
<li>When I'm done or if I feel like working on something else:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do I feel like doing? If there's a specific activity that I feel like:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go to the relevant project/section of my TODO list, or check the TODOs by context (drawing, writing, etc.)
</li>
<li>Clock in on that task.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's a specific task I feel like working on:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Find the task, maybe with <code>C-u C-c C-w</code> (<code>org-refile</code>) and work on it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there's a new idea I want to work on:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <code>org-capture</code> to create the task, file it in the appropriate project, and then clock in.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I have an idea for a task, use <code>org-capture</code> to create the task and file it in the appropriate project.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
How do I want to improve this?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Maybe get more used to working with contexts?</b> I have all these Org Agenda commands and I hardly ever use them. I tend to work with projects instead. Actually, working with projects makes sense too, because that minimizes the real context shift.
</li>
<li><b>Get better at reviewing existing tasks.</b> I started tracking the number of tasks in each state (DONE, TODO, etc.), which nudged me to review the tasks and cross old tasks off. If I streamline my process for capturing tasks, filing them, and reviewing them by project/context/effort, then I can get better at choosing good tasks to work on from my existing TODO list.
</li>
<li><b>Estimate effort for more tasks, and use that more often</b> I have some reports that can filter or sort by estimated effort. I don't use effort that much, though. Does it makes sense to get into the habit of choosing tasks by estimated time as an alternative approach? I usually have fairly large, flexible blocks of time&#x2026;
</li>
<li><b>Tag things by level of energy required?</b> <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/11/high-energy-and-low-energy-activities/">I want to take advantage of high-energy times.</a> So, when I feel alert and creative, I want to focus on coding and writing. I can save things like paperwork for low-energy times. I can tag some tasks as :lowenergy: and then filter my reports.
</li>
</ul>

More than anything, I wanted time. Ever since I was a kid, I had
always been acutely aware of how short a time we actually have. (Can I
blame this on reading about Raistlin's hourglass eyes in Dragonlance,
which I suppose was my first introduction to Stoic negative
visualization?) Being halfway around the world from family is hard
enough. I see the time pass for my parents in their Facebook pictures

But my own favorite part of the book was in the description of the “Renaissance Man ideal”. This is the idea that you will have the most enjoyable life, AND the best chance at very early financial independence, by developing a whole load of interesting skills. The amazing part is that these skills don’t just sit independently in your mind like a bunch of unused kitchen appliances in a pantry. They start to reach out and connect to each other in unexpected ways, and start solving all of your problems for you. They build your curiosity and start sucking in still more skills that you can’t help acquiring. And before you know it, you are able to live a superb life on only a tiny fraction of the spending that a normal person does, even while you might end up accidentally earning money even more easily than before you embraced the Renaissance Ideal.

It’s been more than ten years since David Allen published Getting

but Emacs + Org + Evernote is getting there. I’m glad I’m back to
using Org. I’m starting to run into the reminders I set for important
business paperwork last year, and I might have missed that if I was

<p>
From time to time, when I catch myself feeling frazzled, I stop and
write down all of my open loops: the things that tug on my attention.
Some of them must be ruthlessly demoted to “someday/maybe,” or even
let go. And then I can methodically go through the others, crossing
them off as I finish them. Getting it all down on paper helps me make
sense of things and stops me from feeling overwhelmed.

<h3 id="sec-8-1">Is your podcast a good fit for sketchnotes?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">
<p>
Do you produce "evergreen" content that people regularly want to refer to? You'll get lasting value from sketchnotes about topics that are perennially interesting or useful, while time-sensitive or news updates have limited benefits.
</p>

<p>
Do you have a large, social-media savvy audience in terms of blog readers, website visitors, or social media followers? Sketchnotes can help you convert them to podcast listeners or get them to check out a specific podcast. It can also get more value out of other resources such as blog posts and e-books. Newsletter subscribers and podcast subscribers don't get as much immediate value from sketchnotes because they don't see them right away. If you're active on Twitter or Facebook, you'll be able to get more value out of the sketchnotes because of embedded images in the news stream as well as RTs and CCs.
</p>

<p>
Is your podcast a source of revenue? What kind of business benefit do you anticipate? What kinds of increases in readership or other benefits would you consider worth different levels of investment (knowing there's no such thing as a guarantee&#x2026; =) )? Sketching an episode that already has an edited transcript can be more cost-effective, because transcripts allow the sketchnote artist can get an quick overview of the podcast's structure and confirm the spelling of important words.

<p>
Imagine I have amazing assistants and a smoothly-running team. What am I doing with those capabilities?
</p>

<p>
2 days a week, I'm focused on talking to people. I'm booked efficiently; tea, lunch, tea, second tea. Some of these meetings involve walks instead of food. The meetings cluster in various locations in order to minimize travel time. I might have one day for face-to-face meetings and one day for virtual meetings.
</p>

<p>
After each meeting, I have at least half an hour to define next actions and get the ball rolling. It's easy to prioritize based on time and importance. We get the first actions out right away, impressing people, and then we follow up with depth. My assistant fills in the time with other tasks from the next actions list. I have at least 20 hours of work for people, so it's easy for them to focus.
</p>

<p>
Types of things I delegate:
Scheduling - I forward them emails and get back neatly formatted calendar entries
Email response handling - they read my mail, prioritize, send me action items, and work on tasks.
Web research - I send them questions and get back summaries of the top ten resources I should read. I suggest search queries, and they add their own.
Illustration - I have backup illustrators who can sketchnote things that I can't get to, or who can share different styles and metaphors.
Development - When I have an idea about Rails or Wordpress, I can work with someone to make it happen.
Web design - themes, tweaks, beautifully HTMLized pages&#x2026;
Copywriting and copyediting - I send things over and get polished, engaging content
Calls - Assistants can take care of calling businesses when they're open and following up if needed, such as when setting appointments or making reservations.
Layout - I share a Dropbox folder with a bunch of graphics or documents. The assistant lays things out so that they're well-balanced in terms of whitespace and size.
Transcription - I save webinars and interviews (or set people up to record) into a Dropbox shared folder, and I send an email. I get a well-formatted blog post or document with the cleaned-up transcript.
Outlining and writing - someone helps me brainstorm blog post topics and outlines, fleshing them out with research, and organizing the topics into books
Video - editing, synchronizing sound, adding transitions, etc.
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I also have recurring tasks for projects and initiatives I care about. Things just work smoothly. I get confirmations.
</p>

<p>
I have this lovely web-based process manual and a visual overview of tasks.
</p>

<p>
I'm always collecting people for my pipeline.
Hiring is not stressful - I have good onboarding and offboarding
processes. I hire shortly before I really need to, so that I can ramp
up people.

Draw this
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Take notes
</li>
<li>Why
</li>

<li>Take hand-written notes
</li>

<li>Slow down and write legibly
You don't have to write everything
Leave yourself space, then come back and fill things in later
A good ink helps: find one that's readable and doesn't smear
Tip: stash pens everywhere so that you're never without one!
</li>

<li>Emphasize important concepts
Boxes, highlighter, color pencils, etc
(Test the highlighter - sometimes ink can get messed up!)
</li>

<li>Use simple shapes.
Star - important point
Box, check - TODO
Arrow - next step
Speech bubble - quote
Thought cloud - what you were thinking
Lightbulb - idea

<p>
Make rough copies of diagrams
</p>
</li>

<li>Have fun by drawing faces. This is a surprisingly good way to
remember an event, and it's also a good way to settle in if you're
early. (Being early is great for grabbing good seats.)

<p>
Write down the topic title and the speaker name, then spend a few
minutes sketching the person's face. You can start with a simple
rectangle with roughly the right proportions. Hair style? Glasses
or eyes? Nose? Facial hair? Smile? Doesn't have to be perfect.
</p>
</li>

<li>Draw other icons. People often repeat themselves or say things you
don't have to write down, so you can doodle during those parts.
Draw simple images related to what people are talking about. (Or
draw things that are completely unrelated - up to you!) Listen for
visual metaphors and try to draw them. Leave yourself space, and
then come back and doodle when you have time.
</li>
</ol>

Whenever I sketchnote an event, people tell me that they love my work. They ask if I'd be interested in sketching other events, podcasts, books, presentation designs, blog post illustrations, and so on. People love the informal, informative style of sketchnotes, and they want to use it to spread more ideas. Terrific!
</p>

<p>
<b>But you know what would be even awesomer? It would be fantastic if <i>more</i> people could get into sketchnoting - pro-bono, for barter, or professionally.</b> There are a lot of great ideas out there that are missing their potential because they get forgotten or people's eyes glaze over when confronted by lots of text or slides. More sketchnoters, more possibilities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Many sketchnoters and graphic recorders refer work to people they know when they're too busy themselves.</b> I want to refer as much as possible to other people, especially people I don't know. I want to broaden the network and bring more people in. I want my default to be referring work to other people, accepting work myself only if it's something I really care about and I'm the only one who can make it happen. (Which is probably never, because lots of people can draw!)
</p>

<p>
<b>It makes sense to have lots of sketchnoters sharing the opportunities instead of a few sketchnoters drawing most of the work.</b> When a topic lines up with your interests or background, everything is better. You have a richer visual vocabulary. You learn a lot more from the content. You can keep up with speakers more easily. And when there are lots of active sketchnoters, we can learn a lot from each other's styles.
</p>

<p>
<b>I think it would be interesting to have a gig board</b> where people can post opportunities and other people can contact them if interested. This is different from a job board because jobs tend to be longer-term commitments, while sketchnoting might just be a few hours. I don't mind routing everything through my e-mail first.
</p>

<p>
So, what's getting in people's way now, and how can we address that?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A slowly growing market</b>: Although some event organizers have been taking advantage of graphical summaries as a way of reaching out to attendees and prospects, graphic recording is still pretty limited in terms of conferences and corporate events. Sketchnoting is still pretty novel.

<p>
I'm not going to focus on event organizers who don't know about sketchnoting yet. It's helpful to have a place where organizers who want sketchnotes can connect with sketchnoters.
</p>

<p>
Many events have limited budgets, especially in this economy, so they might not be able to afford professional sketchnoting. However, if a pro-bono or barter event matches up with a sketchnoter's interests, maybe the sketchnoter will do it anyway. Besides, I want to encourage organizers to think of more creative bartering opportunities: links? sponsorship? feedback over lunches? ticket giveaways? introductions? testimonials?
</p>

<p>
How is this different from, say, simply showing up at an event and taking notes? Connecting with the organizers beforehand makes it easier for the organizers and the sketchnoters to make the most of the sketches. The organizers might be able to arrange complimentary tickets, perhaps including an extra ticket that the sketchnoter can raffle off or trade with someone else. The organizer can help publicize the sketchnotes, and the sketchnoters can get a wider audience.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>The power law:</b> Sketchnoters who post their notes publicly get lots of requests, which lead to more sketches, which lead to more requests. There are even more sketchnoters who haven't made that jump. Maybe they're not comfortable posting their work online or their website isn't popular, but they'd be fine with e-mailing an organizer samples of their work.
</li>

<li><b>Sketchnoters might be too intimidated to make the leap.</b> I remember being nervous the first time I committed to sketchnoting an event for a fee. What if things fell through? What if I wasn't good enough? It turns out that an excellent way to deal with risk is to offer a guarantee, which is good for the client <i>and</i> good for you. As for worrying I wasn't good enough&#x2013;I figured the client was grown-up enough to make decisions based on my online portfolio. If they thought my stick figures were awesome, then okay!

<p>
I can help sketchnoters get over their intimidation by talking through their concerns and helping them mitigate them. For example, I sometimes worry about my tools failing on me, so I bring backups. There are lots of things you can plan for or around.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you're intimidated, you might pair up with another sketchnoter, especially at a pro-bono event. Connecting with the organizer and the other sketchnoter(s) beforehand will make it easier to, say, sit together with the other person or swap URLs afterwards.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have a couple of requests that I'd like to refer to other people. What would be a good way of sharing them?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A. <b>Post them on my regular blog in a new category</b>, coordinating with the people who want them posted. Tag with keywords. List open opportunities in the sidebar. Continue doing this until I start receiving requests from other people, then split it off into a separate blog.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advantage: No need to maintain a different site.
</li>
<li>Disadvantage: Blog clutter, and people may find it difficult to see just those posts.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B. <b>Create a new site.</b> Post the current requests there after coordinating with the people who want them posted, tagging with keywords. List open opportunities in the sidebar. Tweet announcements and link to them from my main blog; spread the word. Accept requests by e-mail or contact form. Eventually look into job board plugins if there's a lot of interest. It should also have a newsletter that people can sign up for. Eventually this might even have people's profiles.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Advantage: Uncluttered. Can customize display.
</li>
<li>Disadvantage: May go stale. Probably a good idea to create it on
one of my domains first (maybe somewhere under Sketchnote
Index?). Need to maintain another site.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I like option B more. So let's run it as a little experiment&#x2026; Here are some possible outcomes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Okay:</b> If I post my current requests there and I don't find anyone,
well, at least I have a place to post future requests, and I can say I've tried.
</li>
<li><b>Good:</b> If I match people to my current requests and have a handy place for me to refer future requests, that's fine even if I don't get external requests.
</li>
<li><b>Better:</b> If other people subscribe to it and are interested in hearing about opportunities, that's a double-win. 
</li>
<li><b>Best:</b> If people start submitting requests and it gets to the point where it makes sense to build a job post submission interface or a geolocated search, that's a triple win.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm not going to invest a lot of time into it in the beginning, so I might start with a simple theme and no development work. As we see the response, I can make it better. 
</p>

<p>
Sounds like a plan! Any thoughts or suggestions?

<p>
I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.
</p>

<p>
Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a
</p>

<p>
I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.
</p>

<p>
Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder&#x2026;

How to listen and draw at the same time
</p>


<p>
When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!

I’ve been reading through Mr. Money Mustache’s blog archive, and his blog post on What would you do with WAY MORE money? made me think about what I value and what I would change. Like him, I’m comfortable with the way things are. I like eating at home. I like getting books and movies from the library instead of buying them. (No storage or waste issues, wide selection, and the satisfaction of boosting library circulation statistics…) I like my hobbies and interests. I like my freedom from the endless hedonic treadmill.
Not even the latest apps or gadgets, aside from the occasional experiment. (Shh! I hope they don’t take away my geek card. ;) )
About the only thing that would be awesomer would be to make more frequent trips to the Philippines (maybe every year! or on a whim!) or to join family and friends on their vacations. Although that’s constrained by other things too, like the fact that I like spending time with W- and he needs to be here in Toronto for J-.

It’s finally spring in full force, and I’ve been biking whenever I can get away with it. The bike ride is a little faster than the subway commute to my client, and I like not have to squeeze into the crowded train. Free exercise along a well-maintained trail with plenty of flowers and trees…

<p>
I'd been contemplating this question for the past four years.
</p>

<p>
What's worth spending on? I invest for the future, save for unexpected expenses, and support causes and people - but it's good to have that discretionary part of my budget which I can use to enjoy life and learn how to make better decisions.
</p>

<p>
Many people care about stuff. I apporeciate that. There are many examples of things that have enabled me to enjoy and learn from life so much more, such as my tablet PC.
</p>

<p>
Many people care about experiences. I appreciate that, too. I like how experiences can lead to deeper relationships.
</p>

<p>
Many people know something else that I'm just beginning to figure out. You can spend on people, on time, on making things happen. This is awesome! There's a candy store of talent out there - a world full of people with unique experiences, skills, and passions.
</p>

<p>
Like the way I've learned about what works well for me in terms of
spending on stuff and experiences, I want to learn how to spend on
making things happen. And who knows? If I can get good enough at it,
maybe I can learn how to create so much value that it becomes a
self-perpetuating machine.

When I <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/02/experience-report-incorporating-a-federal-numbered-corporation-in-canada/">incorporated a company</a> for my experiments with semi-retirement, I chose a September 30 year-end following the advice of the Internet. (That way, you avoid the overcrowded post-Dec 31 scramble.)
</p>

<p>
It's the end of my second fiscal year. I thought I'd review my decisions for reinvesting profits, plan ahead, and ask for feedback. Here's how I reinvested some of my profits this year:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Tools and education</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I bought $289 worth of books, including pricey but useful books on drawing emotions and stick figures (Bikablo, from Neuland). I've made the most of them by reading, taking notes, and sharing what I've learned, so this was definitely worth it. 
</li>
<li>I also took the <a href="http://alphachimpu.com/?ap_id=sachac">AlphaChimp Rockstar Scribe course</a> (CAD 298.66, it's now USD 497; affiliate link). I picked up a few tips on digitizing scanned sketches (lesson 6: digital documentation). The exercises also prompted me to put together my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/11/coming-up-with-a-three-word-life-philosophy/">3-word life philosophy</a> and my <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/01/imagining-the-next-five-years-and-planning-2013/">5-year plan</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Connecting with people</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The biggest chunk here was flying to London for the Emacs Conference, which was a great way to connect with people, create resources, and develop skills. 
</li>
<li>I also signed up for HackLab ($51.75 a month) as a way to connect with other geeks and have a place to work at when I'm downtown. 
</li>
<li>I attended networking events ($170.45). AndroidTO was less useful than I expected because I hadn't actually been developing stuff then, although it was good sketchnoting practice. The Third Tuesdays Toronto events were definitely worth it for me. Rotman events were okay.
</li>
<li>I met four people for lunches/dinners and had lots of tea with others, talking about mentoring or business opportunities.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delegation</b>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I greatly increased my delegation budget compared to last year. I subcontracted $1,333.34 of my work. I delegated an additional $2,030.30.
</li>
<li>Hiring a virtual assistant to help with scheduling really helped me get past the hassles of booking people. Worth it.
</li>
<li>Hiring a transcriber for my podcasts and presentations worked out well, too.
</li>
<li>Hiring a local consultant to help me brainstorm was okay, but not amazing. It was a helpful nudge to work on my marketing, though.
</li>
<li>Hiring another on-shore consultant to give me feedback on my website and e-books was also okay but not amazing. It was great for pushing me to add more hand-drawn elements to my website, though.
</li>
<li>Hiring a developer to work on Rails prototypes gave me a leg up on dealing with various APIs, although I ended up not pursuing the projects.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I made $90 in e-book sales in FY 2013, which absolutely delights me. It's a tiny fraction of what I make in consulting or even sketchnoting or speaking, but it's a start. I've been moving towards a Pay What You Want model so that everyone can get access to the resources and people can show their appreciation by funding future experiments. My experiment-related savings take care of my living expenses, so everything goes to Making Stuff. I want to focus on making more things. 
</p>

<p>
For this coming year, I'm planning to focus on consulting until it winds down. I'm also going to ramp up creating content: blog posts, drawings, articles, e-books, courses, and more. I often get requests to sketchnote events or other people's content, and I'd like to refer those to other people instead of handling them myself. That way, I can help other people grow, and I can make myself learn more about creating my own content.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ideally, by September 2014, I'll have:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a separate topic-focused weekly blog with evergreen posts and useful, well-formatted, illustrated articles
</li>
<li>several e-resources for that blog
</li>
<li>a mailing list that I've learned how to use
</li>
<li>and possibly a course that includes tips, worksheets, checklists, animations, and video
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I may also want to keep a "Wanted" board on my site so that I can funnel other requests to it. That way, instead of simply telling people no, I can help them a little further along the way and help other people grow their businesses too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here's my plan for getting there:</b>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Brainstorm headlines and article ideas to help me choose which topics I want to start a weekly topic-focused blog around. 
</li>
<li>Get feedback on which topics people would like to read about first. Start collecting e-mail addresses for launch.
</li>
<li>"Bank" 4-8 good articles (write two months ahead). Invite early readers.
</li>
<li>Publicize it a bit more widely once I've gotten into the rhythm of publishing on the blog and I know that the rate is sustainable.
</li>
<li>Plan an outline for a brief e-book and gear my articles towards that.
</li>
<li>Reach out and find guest posting opportunities once the blog is more established.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To make the blog different and useful, I plan to illustrate the ideas with one-page cheat sheets / references. This will also make a handy collection.
</p>

<p>
<b>With that in mind, what are some ways I can reinvest some of my profits in order to make things better, and which ways make more sense than others?</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Buy premium plugins, scripts, or themes</b> to make navigating the blog or content easier.
</li>
<li><b>Buy books, read them, and give them away</b>. That way, I'm not limited to the library's selection. The library has lots of books and it could take forever for me to get through the backlog, but learning from and sharing tips from newly-published books may create more value for readers. Plus, if I set aside a budget for shipping (which is expensive in Canada!), I can give lightly-read copies away. I've had publishers send me copies of books to review, so maybe I can ramp that up also.
</li>
<li><b>Buy domain names</b> and learn how to set up landing pages.
</li>
<li><b>Work with copywriters and editors</b> and get better at writing.
</li>
<li><b>Sign up for a good mailing list service</b>, possibly with an autoresponder or digital delivery mechanism
</li>
<li><b>Get an assistant to help me with e-mail.</b>
</li>
<li><b>Buy SEO tools or work with a reputable company.</b> Sometimes little tweaks make things more findable or discoverable.
</li>
<li><b>Find a system administrator</b> who can help me review my config and who can answer questions from time to time
</li>
<li><b>Learn how to work with article writers</b> or pay for excellent guest posts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Worst-case scenario: They write the first draft, and I end up rewriting it extensively because I have a better idea of what I don't want.
</li>
<li>Best-case scenario: I give them a topic to write about, they come up with insights or research I might not have come across myself, and then I can personalize it with more stories or experiences.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Invest in better web planning and design</b>, maybe for the topic-focused blog
</li>
<li><b>Experiment with richer media</b>: animations, podcasts, video. Buy tools. Possibly delegate editing.
</li>
<li><b>Hire someone to format e-resources.</b> They can help develop the template and lay things out nicely.
</li>
<li><b>Go through a course</b> like the ones offered at Platform University, CopyBlogger, or ProBlogger. Apply the lessons and write about my experiences. Draw notes.
</li>
<li><b>Hire a coach</b> to help me learn more about planning posts, creating resources or courses, building a community, and so on.
</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>I pass on work because I'm conscious of my rate and we're working with the budget
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If someone else can do it (ex: a student on our team), then it's better for them to have the learning opportunity.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I try to stay close to what I know or can help with instead of building up skills during client time. So, yes to troubleshooting or looking up
API details, but no to longer-term improvements such as going through web design courses. (I can do that on my own time.) If I invest time in
building those skills, then I'll feel all right doing more work.
</li>
<li>I say yes to work when my teammates need help with their workload. I'm okay with weekends and holidays because I get plenty of discretionary
time during the week. This probably means I can take on more work if my teammates feel overloaded, if they think it's good value. (Happiness
is worth it.)

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Save more:</b> make our safety buffer bigger, start working on W-'s retirement. Easy path.
</li>
<li><b>Live more:</b> replace activities we don't particularly like doing with more discretionary time, or add more relaxation/life stuff (massages)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most of my tasks give me personal benefit, and I don't want to get used to lifestyle inflation
</li>
<li>It feels wasteful to pay for chores (ex: washing the dishes, cooking food), especially as I get a lot of enjoyment out of those activities
too (washing dishes = creative downtime, cooking food = family)
</li>
<li>Not likely to pursue this path
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Earn more:</b> replace activities we don't particularly like doing with more work time
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I earn more than I would pay someone for the tasks I would replace
</li>
<li>If I could, say, work one hour and hire out or accelerate three hours (net gain of two hours)
</li>
<li>but my limiting factor isn't really time, and the things I want to invest in don't have an immediate time=money result, so it blends into the next category&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Learn more:</b> replace activities with more learning and making
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do I get more value out of building those life skills now instead of earning money to buy the time later?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Three steps: work more, delegate more, and then fill that time with something productive
</li>
<li>versus working less (or the same) and directly filling the time with something productive
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>comparative advantage if
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>working more lets me give myself permission to invest in more tools and education, speeding up learning/doing by 2-3x 
</li>
<li>working 1 hour lets me free up 2-3 hours with minimal admin overhead.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually, I would want to bank at least half of any extra. So I should make a business plan that looks for twice the ROI.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Oh, there's an idea there&#x2026; Maybe I should make a "business plan" for my learning, and identify where I can accelerate it.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How would I invest in specifics?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>What are the activities I could reduce?</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Grocery shopping and library errands - revisit my online grocery shopping experiment?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Social time with W-
</li>
<li>15% premium for 1 hour per week; time spent shopping online, so maybe 45 min saved per week? 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Litter-box cleaning: ~15min/day. Tried paying J- to do it, but offer not motivating enough for her. Doesn't make sense to have someone else come in and do it. Should take on other chores to offset&#x2026;
</li>
<li>Weekly laundry: pretty easy. Social time with W-, and watching movies.
</li>
<li>Weekly or bi-weekly cleaning
</li>
<li>Offset some of W-'s activities, such as working on the deck?
</li>
<li>Video games?
</li>
<li>Actually, my life is pretty trim
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>What are the activities I could invest in?</b> TODO Post this as a quick question - what would people like me to invest more into?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Writing:</b> Buy recent books instead of relying on the library. Give stuff away. Invest time in formatting, or pay someone to format. Interview people and send them gift certificates. Go for a course. Get a coach. Experiment with writing topic-focused blogs and delegation. Buy premium plugins or themes. Pay a designer, coder, editor, or social media person. Get things transcribed. Learn how to work with writers?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Platform University? Copyblogger? ProBlogger Academy? Firepole Marketing?
</li>
<li>Let's say that I want writing to become a larger stream of income. What would I need to do?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Plan content
</li>
<li>Reach out to people (bloggers, potential community)
</li>
<li>Create, organize, and format content
</li>
<li>Put content up for sale
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Drawing:</b> Get and learn how to use Illustrator, maybe once we've got a Windows desktop set up. Learn 3D modeling, buy models. Learn animation, buy tools. 
</li>
<li><b>Coding:</b> Buy premium plugins, scripts or themes. Experiment with digital delivery systems when Gumroad volume gets large enough. Have someone I can send technical questions to with payment or gifts of appreciation? Maybe indirectly through my blog - send more gift certificates?
</li>
<li><b>Connecting:</b> Treat people to food (either at home or outside) - maybe outside so that I don't feel self-conscious about home. Visit family and friends in the Philippines. (Don't want to trade off time with W-, though.) Learn how to make or buy gifts. Buy stamps. Buy ingredients and make HackLab dinners. Schedule more get-togethers with people.
</li>
<li><b>Making:</b> Take a class (cooking, sewing, home maintenance)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take a cooking class? I can buy a lot of ingredients with that money.
</li>
<li>Sewing class? Took one. YouTube is amazing and convenient. Class interactivity wasn't that compelling. Other people have learned this before, and I can too.
</li>
<li>Home maintenance skills? Checking for workshops
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Fitness:</b> Sign up for classes. Rotate through classes/gyms a month at a time until I find something I love. Make biking in winter safer and more comfortable.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's easier to think of investing time rather than money. I've got lots of ideas for investing time.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So maybe it makes sense to keep my surplus as time instead of converting it into money&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What's another approach?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep my unpaid work and earning time the same
</li>
<li>Plan for a reduction in earning time, so I know what activities will take the surplus time and I can direct it instead of frittering it away
</li>
<li>Minimize external commitments; refer work to other people instead of taking on time=money trades
</li>
<li>Force myself to double-down on creating content that's useful for other people
</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
Decisions
</p>
</li>
<li>I'll probably step up consulting a little because things are working well. Maybe 2.5 days a week instead of 2, maybe
even 3 if the balance keeps and the budget holds.
</li>
<li>I'll refer other time=money swaps to people, doing only what I need to do. This builds a network of skills.
</li>
<li>I'll save surplus money instead of making myself use it. 
</li>
<li>As consulting winds down, I'll assign the surplus time to creating content, getting really good at writing and drawing and reaching out.
</li>
<li>I'll start "banking" evergreen posts until I reach enough that it makes sense to create a topic-focused blog. This gets around my worry that it will be a stale one. Maybe 12, 26, or 52? Likely candidates: sketchnoting, blogging, personal finance.
</li>
<li>I <b>won't</b> throw money at the problem. I'll pretend that I'm bootstrapping content. I'll use my opportunity fund for small experiments or good wins, gradually scaling it up.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I predict that these decisions will:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Give me a comfortable safety buffer
</li>
<li>Keep me hungry and creative instead of letting me make lazy decisions about tools or delegation
</li>
<li>Limit my growth a little, but keep it manageable
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>what are my decision criteria?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>in line with my interests, focus areas, and desired skills
<ul class="org-ul">

</li>
<li>What if I can improve my skills faster with external requests instead of internal motivation?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want to get better at internal motivation anyway

<li>Where do I offer value that is difficult to substitute?
<ul class="org-ul">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-10-3-6">
<p>
<b>People sometimes get the impression that I'm this super-busy, super-productive person. I'm not.</b> Thanks to this experiment with semi-retirement, I'm probably the least busy person I know, at least in terms of people less than 60 years old. I try to get one or two good things done each day. The difference, I suppose, is that I write about it, so the days don't blur together and I can actually tell you where the time went.
</p>

<p>
I try hard to not be busy. I minimize the number of commitments I make. I still occasionally turn down invitations or requests, but I'm up front about my reasons. It's not that I'm busy, I've just got other priorities. It's not that I'm busy, it's that I'm tired and want to sleep in. It's not that I'm busy, it's that I don't feel up to it right now. (Introvert mode strikes again.) It's not that I'm busy, I just want to keep the time open so I can follow where my interests lead me.
</p>



<p>
There are two types of balance that I pay attention to. One is my bank balance, of course. As long as it remains comfortably high, I'm okay. 
</p>

<p>
The other balance, the more important one, is the balance of how W-
feels about this experiment. He works long hours, although he's also
got great work-life balance and enjoys the occasional walk to the
library while his code compiles. 
</p>

<p>
I work more than I estimated I needed. I'm keeping the same frugal lifestyle, but the excess can go towards our safety buffer and possibly his early retirement too.
</p>


<p>
Sometimes I give myself permission to play video games most of the
afternoon, after learning interesting things and writing several blog
posts along the way.

<h4 id="sec-10-3-8">Learning how to be</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-10-3-8">
<p>
This is probably the hardest part of semi-retirement: learning how to
be. Learning to let go of the need to check things off a list or do
things that I consider productive. Learning how to ignore the clock
and follow the flow.
</p>

<p>
Look, I'm writing a blog post instead of staring off into space. This
time, I'm not starting with an outline. We'll just see where this post
goes.
</p>

<p>
It's not all "work." I sleep in, and I go for walks, and I get on my
bike and go to places even if I don't need to. I cook and I read and I
garden. I tidy. I play video games.
</p>

<p>
They're still all verbs. That's okay. The goal isn't to do <i>nothing</i>,
the goal is to be where I am: unhurried, present, not frustrated, not
judging myself for what I do or don't do.
</p>

<p>
Pretty good, actually.

How to say no to opportunities

<p>
(Needs more work)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When I started this 5-year experiment, I didn't know if I could
stick with it. My track record for sticking with interests is not
that good. I'm delighted to report that (semi-)retirement gets
easier and easier. I am learning to say no.
</li>
<li>By coincidence, two of my mentors (who had moved on to separate
companies after IBM) got in touch with me recently to find out if I
was interested in some upcoming job opportunities. Good stuff.
Right up my alley. Wonderful people.
</li>
<li>I said no. Actually, I said something along the lines of: Thank you
for reaching out! That sounds fantastic. However, I am semi-retired
and completely* unhireable for at least the next few years, so I'll
just have to wish you good luck on your search. I'm sure you'll find
someone awesome out there.
</li>
<li>(Of course, if a significant financial need comes up, I have no qualms about
suspending this experiment and returning to the wonderful world
of work. I enjoyed working with excellent teams. I'd love to do
it again.
</li>
<li>Learning how to say no is incredibly amazing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It helps to remember that there are other awesome people out there
who can make things happen. 
</li>
<li>Sure, they might not bring my particular configuration of skills,
but they'll bring other useful combinations.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't even have a tiny internal voice of dissent

Here's my evolving break-down of blogging-related skills, including
notes for future blog posts. I'm currently working on getting better
at <b>outlining</b> (from high-level down to chunks of ~100 words)
and <b>synthesizing</b> (especially combining other people's insights with
my experiences). I'm using this outline to think of ways to
deliberately practise certain aspects of blogging, to plan posts that
will help people learn, and to clarify what I would like to delegate
to assistants or work with coaches for.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-9">
<p>
I've been thinking about my goals for blogging because I want to get better. I write almost every day, fueled by habits of reading and experimenting. I have time to learn things, and I can learn more effectively if I learn deliberately. Here's what I'm learning about being clear about your goals and analyzing how your actions match up with them.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-11-9-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-11-9-1">1. Clarify your goals</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-9-1">
<p>
It's good to know what your goals are and how the different approaches serve those goals so that you can choose the ones that are the most effective. You can also look at each approach to see how you can improve it.
</p>

<p>
After some reflection, I came up with this list of goals for my blog:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Learn more effectively by thinking through complexity or explaining what I'm learning
</li>
<li>Explore assumptions and possibilities; become more aware of them myself, and help other people see them
</li>
<li>Improve core skills through practice: making decisions, explaining ideas, organizing thoughts, etc.
</li>
<li>Save myself and other people time spent re-solving the same problems or learning the same things
</li>
<li>Build a long-term archive that I can use to remember what I'm learning and see differences over time
</li>
<li>Learn from other people through questions, comments, and conversations
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Your list of goals will probably look different. Many people have goals such as building a business by promoting their products or services, educating clients or readers, keeping family members up to date, working through difficult issues by writing anonymously, and so on. Take a moment to think about and prioritize your goals.
</p>

<p>
If you're having problems expressing your goals, you can also take a look at your recent blog posts and ask yourself, "Why did I write this?" What results did you want to get? What purpose did it serve? One blog post might work towards several different goals.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-11-9-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-11-9-2">2. Analyze the ways you approach those goals</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-9-2">
<p>
Different actions support different goals to different extents. Think about the different types of blog posts you write. Score them against each of your goals on a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 5 means that type of post helps a specific goal a lot, while 1 means it does very little or even nothing for that particular goal.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the types of posts I share and how they line up with the goals I listed above:

Sorting the table by the total score makes it easy to see which approaches you value more. If some goals are much more important to you than others, you can also weight those goals in your calculations. For example, if building a long-term archive was twice as important to me, I could double that column when calculating the total score. 
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this ranking makes it clearer why I feel good about original drawings and sketchnotes, and why I skew towards decision reviews and "thinking through things"-type posts even if they don't feel focused enough on saving other people time. Most of the blogging advice tends to focus on writing tips, but they don't motivate me as much. 
</p>

<p>
How about you? Do your post types match up with your goals? Are there clear winners that you should focus on? You can write lower-value posts from time to time because they address different needs. For example, I post weekly reviews because they're useful to me even if they're less useful for others.

<p>
Of course, since these values are subjective, it helps to adjust them based on your website analytics or feedback from your readers. For example, if you think a type of post saves people a lot of time, you'll probably see a lot of visits or comments on it. If you have Google Analytics, you can export the <b>Content - Site Content - All Pages</b> table to a spreadsheet, classify the top X links, and then see what types of posts people spend their time on. For example, I analyzed the top 500 pages visited in July 2013, classified each by type, calculated average views and time per page, and sorted it by average views to get a sense of which posts tend to be more popular.

<p>
My sketchnotes are more popular by far. My technical notes are surprisingly durable over time, even though you'd expect them to be superseded by bugfixes, technical changes, better documentation, and so on. Posts as old as 2004 still turn up. Because people still get a lot of value from my old tech posts, I adjusted the "Save time" rating for tech tips from my original value of 3 to 4. (I had started with a lower value because I figured that not a lot of people would probably have run into the same issues I did, but it turns out that time makes up for audience size and the long tail works.) As I expected, tips that few other people have written about get more pageviews than tips that more people have written about, although I'm surprised that people tend to spend more time on the common tips. My "thinking out loud" posts are more popular than I expected. (Limitations: This only looks at single-page views in a single month.) Also, people tend to click on my weekly reviews if I add a brief description to the title, so that's something.
</p>

<p>
Anecdotally speaking, I get a lot of comments and links to my sketchnotes. I'm also delighted by the conversations that occasionally grow out of the "thinking out loud" posts, and how sometimes people will share even better solutions when I post my technical notes.

<h4 id="sec-11-9-4">4. Identify ways to improve each approach</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11-9-4">
<p>
Now that you've looked at what makes each type of post different, you can focus on how to improve each type by building on its strengths or compensating for its weaknesses. Here's what I'm planning for the kinds of posts I write:
</p>

<p>
<b>Draw original stuff</b>: It takes me 2-4 hours to make one of these. I like making technical notes (ex: Emacs), sketchnote tutorials (to help people draw more), and other drawings related to life and planning. I'm getting used to drawing them with less up-front planning. Even though I end up moving things around, I think it's useful to just get started. Drawing involves a trade-off because images are not as searchable as text. I can fix that by including the text, but it's a little awkward and it takes more time. Still, people like the drawings a lot, and I like them too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Draw book reviews and events:</b> I go to fewer events these days, but I'm reading a lot more books. It takes me two hours to read a typical business book in depth, drawing notes along the way. I tend to draw book reviews only when I've already gotten a sense that a book is worth reading in depth. One way to increase my frequency is to draw book notes based on the skimmed parts of books that I'm not reading deeply - perhaps breaking out just the chapter or idea that resonates with me, and using that to illustrate a blog post reflecting on it. I can also work on getting more high-quality books into my pipeline, or practise by drawing more books with fewer value judgments.
</p>

<p>
<b>Think out loud:</b> I can improve the "Save time" score by stashing the notes in my outline, adding observations, until I've fleshed it out enough for preliminary findings and advice. It means that the output will be more concise in its reasoning and I'll have to do more learning on my own instead of opening up the conversation early, but then the posts will be useful for other people as well as for me. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> is a good example of a blog that mixes personal stories and useful observations. The main thing that was holding me back from doing this before was losing track of my drafts, but my outline is a good step.
</p>

<p>
For example, this post started as a rough outline, thinking out loud about what kinds of posts I wanted to write. Now I'm going back and filling it in with other information that might be useful for people. If it ends up too long, I might have to trim it. We'll get there!
</p>

<p>
<b>Share tech tips, troubleshooting notes, or code:</b> The limiting factor here is that I'm not working on any professional projects that I can write about, so I'm forced to run into and resolve fewer issues. I can replace that with working on my own projects or on open source projects, or helping people with questions. I often tweak or work on things related to Emacs, Wordpress, or data visualization, so there's that. If I set aside time and find a good source of small bugs so that I can ease my way into a habit of contributing to open source again, then that will also help me with my life goal to keep my technical skills sharp.
</p>

<p>
<b>Review longer spans of time:</b> I can increase the frequency of decision reviews by scheduling them so that I don't lose track of items. Because I manage my outline in Org Mode, that should be relatively easy to do. I can also bootstrap this by reviewing last year and last decade's monthly reviews (if available), or the blog posts if not. I have an advantage here because I have a lot of public notes over the years.
</p>

<p>
<b>Write tips that few other people can cover:</b> There are lots of information gaps to fill. Sometimes it's because people don't have the time, inclination, or confidence to write about something. Sometimes it's because I have a useful combination of skills or I can bring a different perspective. If I can't find information, that's a good reason to write it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Write tips that other people can also cover:</b> The world doesn't really need another "how to find the time to blog" tutorial. If I can filter through search results for a good one and make it more findable, that beats writing one from scratch&#x2013;unless I can add something special or relate different types of advice to each other.
</p>

<p>
<b>Review recent posts (weekly, monthly):</b> These are low-value in the short term (mostly lists of links, plus the nudge to do my weekly planning process), but I've found them to be surprisingly useful over the years. They also help keep my large blog archive manageable. That's why I keep posting them. I've started using the weekly and monthly reviews to give people <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/how-i-use-feedburner-to-give-people-the-option-of-different-blog-update-frequencies/">less-frequent subscription options</a> (daily can be a little overwhelming), so that's helpful too.

<p>
"Get better" is a vague goal. If you can identify the specific goals you would like to work toward, different ways to move towards those goals, and specific actions you can take to improve those approaches, you'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of growing. You'll find it easier to recognize or create opportunities to grow, and you can track your progress along the way. You might also be able to identify counter-productive approaches and replace them with ones that move towards more of your goals. Good luck and have fun!

There's a strong correlation (0.84) between the number of visits and the number of comments, which makes sense. There is, however, practically no correlation between the percentage of posts I write for other people and how many posts or visits I get. My Feedburner stats show that my other-focused tend to get clicked on more, although some of my reflective posts are also popular.
Anecdotally, I see my other-focused posts shared on Twitter more often, which makes sense too.
</p>

<p>
Google Analytics lets me look at stats for individual pages, so I
analyzed the stats for July. This doesn't count the times when people
read the entirety of the post on the homepage, just when they view the
individual post by clicking on the link. I looked at the top 100 pages
in terms of number of visits. I classified 70 of those as
"other-focused" and 12 of those as "self-focused". The top
self-focused posts got an average of 143 views per page, while the top
other-focused posts got an average of 233 posts per page. People also
spent an average of 1.7 minutes longer on those pages (5 minutes vs
3.3 minutes).

<p>
What makes good posts like that?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The posts that spread widely tend to be the ones that are visual: the Shy Connector, a Teacher's Guide to Web 2.0 at School, How to Learn Emacs, sketchnotes, sketchnoting tips, and visual book reviews.
</li>
<li>The posts that are surprisingly popular over a long period of time are my technical notes: Emacs, Drupal, Rails, Lotus Notes, and so on. You'd expect them to be superseded by better documentation or changing technology (and sometimes they are), but they tend to endure.
</li>
<li>Sometimes my personal thinking-through-stuff posts unexpectedly resonate with people, and people share their comments and insights. (Ex: <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/03/passion-and-uncertainty/">Passion and uncertainty</a>)
</li>
<li>I don't have to write advice posts from a position of authority ("You should do this, you should do that") in order to be useful. I can create value by:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Describing what's out there (sketchnotes, visual book reviews)
</li>
<li>Sharing my technical troubleshooting notes, work-arounds, hacks, or discoveries from reading documentation/code
</li>
<li>Applying advice to my life and sharing my experiences
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What would success look and feel like?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm going to be selfish about this because I can. =)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is it okay to say that I blog more for myself? Because I do. Although your comments, shares, and links are nice. I feel like I should say that I write for readers. Attention is a gift. Many people would say that attention is valuable, and then turn around and try to sell you something.
</li>
<li>Someday, perhaps, when I have something I want to tell people, and I acquire a Voice of Advice, then I'll write more for other people.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When would I feel good about that?
</li>
<li>Is there something I feel good about?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I feel comfortable giving people advice on learning, reading, making better decisions, trying things out, and sharing.
</li>
<li>I feel comfortable helping people learn more about Emacs, Wordpress, and a little Excel.
</li>
<li>I feel comfortable that drawing is another way to create value.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the meantime
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If I want to invest more time in writing&#x2026;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I would write about things that few people write about
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emacs? Visual thinking? What it's like to make blogging such a part of your learning?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawing, right&#x2026; Although Sketchnote Army does pretty well.
</li>
<li>Something else.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>False dilemma. (Trilemma?) I know. The choice isn't really between these options, and I don't have to make one choice. I can write about all these things in the course of a week. But I wanted to figure out, if I wasn't keen on the first two options, what <i>am</i> I leaning towards, so I can intentionally work on it?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A post that makes me a better person
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change
</li>
<li>The posts I write make me at least a teensy bit better
</li>
<li>Better
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Better at learning and sharing
</li>
<li>Better at making decisions
</li>
<li>Better at resilience and positivity
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In terms of outcome
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Blog posts that represent larger chunks of growing (going from 0.01% to 0.1%)?
Improving by 0.01% every day means getting 4% better in a year, if you're fine with simplified math. Improving by 0.1% every day means getting 44% better in a year.
</li>
<li>One way to do this is to write less, to sit on posts longer until they develop, to start with a hundred ideas and tweak them for days or weeks (or longer!) until they're deep and insightful and useful.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write less? No, I like writing almost every day, and I forget if I don't write things down. &#x2013;verbose Stuff gets lost in my private notes. Here we might have conversations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Arguing against myself: reasons for posting earlier rather than later
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learn from the conversation
</li>
<li>Get feedback
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is it something unusual worth digging into?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flesh things out on demand (in response to people's questions, etc.)
</li>
<li>Get good value from time (diminishing returns?) - 80%
</li>
<li>Throw more pots
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deliberate practice, engagement
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another way to get a feel for what these deeper posts would be like would be to summarize experiences and update them with lessons learned
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, things I've learned in the past ten years, like cooking.
</li>
<li>This will give me a feel for what deeper posts might feel like.
</li>
<li>Then I can play with timeframes
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It would be worth getting the hang of this for new ideas, though.
</li>
<li>So I need to get better at getting better.
</li>
<li>Well, maybe an order of magnitude is ambitious. (0.01% to 0.1% is 10 times!) What would "a little better" look like?
</li>
<li>Grow more
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask better questions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Know what "better" looks like and what direction it's in
</li>
<li>Ask the questions behind the questions
</li>
<li>Ask <i>different</i> questions
</li>
<li>See and question assumptions
</li>

</li>
<li>Research

<li>Describe
</li>
<li>Be less worried
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try things out
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All that considered, I still want to write in small increments
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Behind the scenes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's like the way I take sketchnotes. I try to capture as much as I can instead of summarizing it, because you can summarize based on your notes but it's hard to go the other way around.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I love being able to link to posts from years ago when I was still figuring something out
</li>
<li>There are plenty of people who'll share advice &#x2013; the results of their experiences &#x2013; without sharing (or remembering!) much of the journey along the way.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So what's next for me then?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Getting better at getting better
</li>
<li>Letting outlines steep
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think I like leaving outlines hanging - it gives me something to focus on while doing the dishes or other chores

</li>
<li>But not too navel-gazey
</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why I like Mr. Money Mustache's blog
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Excellent balance of useful and personal
</li>
<li>topic is interesting as well, of course
</li>
<li>frugality - not just pinching pennies or juggling finances, but living well 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are some of the things that Mr. Money Mustache does differently?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The alias is nifty and amusing. 
</li>
<li>He's more frank about finance (naturally).
</li>
<li>He's great at poking fun at himself. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/07/10/if-i-woke-up-broke/">more</a> 
</li>
<li>He uses stronger language, including more intense adjectives and some swearing. He also uses a wider vocabulary and more wordplay. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/04/29/frequently-complained-questions/">more</a> I should totally give myself permission to use less common words. =)
</li>
<li>He uses more stats, calculations, and case studies. <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/">more</a>
</li>
<li>He's more confident about giving advice. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Formatting
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He doesn't always emphasize the key points in his paragraphs, but they're readable anyway.
</li>
<li>His posts tend to be longer.
</li>
<li>He uses shorter paragraphs.
</li>
<li>His tables are formatted more prettily. Hey, sometimes it's the small stuff&#x2026; =)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organization
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He's focused on financial blogging and the frugal lifestyle, while I blog about whatever I'm interested in.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He gets a lot of input from readers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People share their situations and give each other advice
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Layout
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>His front page uses a summary layout with larger visuals.
</li>
<li>He has large graphical ads in the sidebar.
</li>
<li>He uses a serif font and a visually divided background
</li>
<li>His links are underlined in the post body, although not elsewhere.
</li>
<li>Links open in a new window. (Hmm, I've got mixed feelings about that&#x2026;)
</li>
<li>He has a large post footer which has a blog, a new reader welcome, a random link, subscription/social media instructions, a community forum, and a subscription form, previous/next links with titles, and <i>then</i> comments, trackbacks, and the comment form.
</li>
<li>He has a large page footer with a blog roll, popular posts, stats, selected categories, and tags.

<p>
The advice these days is to include a large image in your blog post,
somewhere “above the fold”, so that it can attract attention, visually
break up the page, and make your blog post more interesting.
</p>

<p>
I’m still trying to get the hang of how this might work. Other blogs
do this pretty well – Lifehacker, for example. More often, though,
stock photos look fake. Too posed. Too perfect. I could never quite
get the hang of

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I can get better at visually communicating if I learn how to use
stock photos effectively.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-19">
<p>
It took me a couple of hours, but I finally cleared the 700+ items
that had piled up in my Evernote inbox. Every so often, I go on a
tagging and filing spree. I was thinking about this because Timothy
Kenny told me how he has a virtual assistant file the notes in his
Microsoft OneNote notebooks.
</p>

<p>
Is my filing really worth it? Is it something I value enough to pay
someone else to do? Could I explain what I wanted clearly enough so
that other people could do it? Could I benefit from organization even
if I'm not the one organizing things myself?
</p>

<p>
Before I dig into that, I should probably examine this question: <b>What
do I use Evernote for, and what could "better" look like?</b>
</p>

<p>
Here's a quick summary of the different reasons I use Evernote:

<p>
I have different types of clipping activities:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A. Researching a topic</b>, which results in lots of clips related to a
single topic. Usually in preparation for a blog post or as a way to
answer a question.
</li>
<li><b>B. Casual browsing and clipping</b> based on blog posts, news items, or
other things I come across; roughly topical (ex: skill
development), although may be tagged and filed in different places
</li>
<li><b>C. Saving reference material from email or websites</b>, which should be filed
</li>
<li><b>D. Adding notes on the go using my phone</b>, which should be reviewed
and acted on or filed when I get back to my computer
</li>
<li><b>E. Automatically clipping things based on external input</b>, using
services like IFTTT to archive my blog posts.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are several strategies I could use to manage my Evernote
collection. I can choose different strategies based on the results
that I want. Here are some possibilities:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A. Spend a few extra seconds tagging and filing things when I clip
them.</b> Advantage: I touch something once, so I don't have to recall
the context of an item.
</li>
<li><b>B. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file shortly after
clipping.</b> Advantages: I can select multiple entries and tag them
give them the same tags, and copy all the note links in one go.
</li>
<li><b>C. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file weekly.</b> This is my
current strategy. This isn't working out too well - things pile up.
</li>
<li><b>D. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then teach someone to file.</b>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I think strategy B will give me a good improvement in performance
without me needing to bring in someone else.
</p>

<p>
One of the areas that I could generally improve in is integrating the
notes into my outlines and plans. Instead of just collecting the
information, maybe I can use Copy Note Link and then spend some time
adding those links to my outline. Alternatively, I can copy the
source URL right then and there, find where it fits into my outline,
and paste the link. If org2blog respects comments, I could even use
that as part of my workflow.
</p>

<p>
So if I were to outsource more tasks in order to improve my
effectiveness at learning, I think I'd gain more value from finding
someone who can speed-read like I do, filtering through lots of cruft
on the Internet to find high-quality resources. They could then clip
those pages into Evernote for my review. That might be worth an
experiment or two&#x2026; Let's find out how that works!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-20">
<p>
"<b>Your blog is so eclectic</b>," said someone recently. In one week, I can
write about deep geekery, business, blogging, drawing, decision
making, and cooking. I deliberately shuffle my posts around so that
you get a variety of topics each week. (When I didn't do this kind of
planning, you sometimes got long stretches of geeky posts that went
over everyone else's heads&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
<b>My blog has a lot of different topics because I have a lot of
different interests.</b> The only challenge with <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/12/the-value-of-a-bottleneck/">posting daily</a> is making
myself stick to it instead of publishing two or three posts because I
get carried away. There's always so much to learn and share, and if I
don't write about it, I tend to forget it.
</p>

<p>
<b>I think it's time to experiment with different ways to write.</b> The
variety is fine for other people with wide-ranging interests. The
frequency is a little overwhelming, so I've started directing people
to <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/weekly">weekly</a> and <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/monthly">monthly</a> updates.
</p>

<p>
<b>Please help me plan a new blog that's more focused on a set of
topics.</b> =) One that's updated weekly, so it's more manageable in
terms of reading. One that's written for readers first, instead of
being mostly personal notes that might be useful for other people. I'm
still going to update my personal blog (sachachua.com) with all these
notes, but once a week, I want to post a focused, well-written,
illustrated, "I spent 4-10 hours making something useful for you" post
that saves you time or money.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to focus on general-interest topics so that I can write
posts that might be useful for years and years to come. Tech-related
posts can be difficult to keep current - people come across Emacs blog
posts from 2008, and it can be hard to figure out what needs to be
changed. General topics tend to be longer-lasting.
</p>

<p>
Here is where I need your help and feedback: <b>What do you want to read
about?</b> There's a poll in this blog post. If you don't see it, please
check it out at TODO. If you give me your e-mail address (optional), I
can invite you to check out the blog when it starts out. =) (Sneak
previews!)

<p>
I'll probably branch it out under the "LivingAnAwesomeLife.com" domain
name - maybe in a subdirectory for ease of expansion later on?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

It takes me about two hours to read a business book in depth, creating a visual summary on the go.

<p>
Sketching a 1-hour talk generally takes 2-4 hours, including time to get there and a schedule that usually includes networking.

<p>
Shorter talks tend to be lighter-weight unless they've been rigorously planned and rehearsed.

</li>
<li>RSS is mostly dead. Only geeky people use it. <i>outline</i>
</li>
<li>Automatic e-mail newsletters
</li>
<li>I want to sell things only if they save you a lot of time
</li>
<li>Forget that. I want to give away so much that you almost feel
obliged to help.

<h3 id="sec-11-31">Thoughts on growing an audience</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-31">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes I wonder if I should do more of the "Right Things" when
it comes to building a blog.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Focus on one or two topics so that people will subscribe because
you're consistent and reliable.
</li>
<li>Research keywords so that you can optimize for search engines
queries and write content that will bring people in.
</li>
<li>Reach out to new audiences with guest posts.
</li>
<li>Send e-mail newsletters so that you can build relationships and
so that you can sell to people later on.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can save other people time
</li>
<li>Can learn from more people
</li>
<li>Scale up - create more value for each unit of time I invest
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes I'm envious of blogs with hundreds of comments. On sites
like that, people learn a lot from each other, not just me. But I
remember that reading and responding to comments takes time, and I'd
want to filter through them for spam, and that other people glaze
over when they see pages and pages of comments and end up not
reading them. It's okay. I like the in-depth conversations we have
in comments. I'm not entirely sure if I'm sour-graping, but it seems
to make sense.
</li>
<li>Sometimes I wonder if this should be more like other blogs. But then
that's a well-travelled path, with lots of other people exploring
it. I have this amazing opportunity to try something different. I
should.
</li>
<li>Actually, I already know what I should do&#x2013;what works for me, what
I should do more.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The enduring posts on my blog are either tech notes (Emacs,
Drupal) or sketches.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The clearer my "no", the less I'm distracted from the things that I
can do.
</li>
<li>Like the way I hack around my introversion
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Write about whatever I'm learning about - variety of interests, and
let more focused people use search results and category links
</li>
<li>Look at other people's questions and failed search results to
nudge me to write about certain topics if I'm curious about them
too
</li>
<li>Read good blogs and write about what inspires me, linking.
Invite people who don't have blogs to share their tips and
lessons learned on mine.
</li>
<li>Build relationships through comments. Give away as much as I
can of what I know. Let people show their appreciation if they
want to. Money is nice, but there are other ways too.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risks in getting too big
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Internet has a seamy underside
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introvert
</li>
<li>The time I would spend in pitching guest posts, etc.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nearly 39,000 people visited in May, when I published

<li>Plenty of blogs

<li>Lots of infographics

<li>Not that many useful, non-marketing drawings
</li>

<li>It's okay

<li>Are there low-effort, high-benefit things I can do to make this better?

<ul class="org-ul">

Mr. Collins in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (Jane Austen)

<p>
After three successive weekends (three!) with parties, I want to think about small talk and how I can tweak it. Small talk is unavoidable, but there are things you can do to nudge it one way or another. I like having conversations that move me or other people forward, even if it's just by a little bit.

So, what do I want to do with small talk?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Help other people feel comfortable enough to open up about some memorable interest or quirk
</li>
<li>Find topics of common interest for further conversation
</li>
<li>Find a way to help or a reason to follow up
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We could do the ritualistic weather/profession/how-do-you-know-the-host conversations, or we could change the level of the conversation so that it goes beyond the repetitive gestures that only skim the surface. I could chat as a way of passing time (possibly bumping into interesting thoughts along the way), or I can more deliberately check for things I'm interested in while staying open to the serendipity of random connections. What do I want to be able to frequently do through conversation?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify possible meetup or global community members - reassure them that this is a thing and that lots of people are interested in it; point people to resources (Emacs, QS, visual thinking)
</li>
<li>Talk shop with other geeks to find out about tech and business things worth looking into
</li>
<li>Other geeks (non-tech): learn more about different fields
</li>
<li>Non-geeks: See if there's anything I can help with easily (books? ideas?)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I could either dig into people's interests or be memorable enough so that people look me up afterwards. Many people open up about their interests only when they feel comfortable. What makes people feel more comfortable? It helps to establish a sense of similarity and shared understanding.
</p>

<p>
People have different strategies for establishing similarity. I know a few people who use the "You look really familiar&#x2026;" approach (even if the other person doesn't) because rattling off schools, companies, associations, and interests tends to reveal something in common.
</p>

<p>
I like building on stuff I've overheard or asking questions about common context. That's one of the reasons why I like events with presentations more than events that are focused only on networking - the presentation gives us something to start talking about.
</p>

<p>
In terms of helping people get to know me and find topics of shared interest, I use short disclosures with high information value.
</p>

<p>
<b>Consulting:</b> "I'm a consultant" has low information value: it's vague and it wouldn't establish much similarity even if the other person was also a consultant. I rarely use it unless I'm tired, I want to shift the focus back on the other person quickly, or I sense they're also going through the motions. (Or I want to see at what point their eyes glaze over&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
<b>Emacs:</b> "I'm working on some Emacs projects" has high information value when talking to tech geeks, almost like a secret handshake that lets us shift the conversation. (I talk faster, go into more detail, and use more jargon when talking to fellow geeks, so it's almost like the 56kbps modem handshake.) I'm female, I don't wear geeky T-shirts, and I don't work for a technical company or in a technical position, so it helps to verbally establish geek cred quickly without making a big deal out of it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Data analysis</b>: For geeks of other fields, Emacs is low-information, but Quantified Self and data analysis seems to be a good way to establish that similarity quickly. It works well with people who are interested in science, tech, engineering, math, or even continuous improvement. Litter box analysis is surprisingly engaging as a cocktail party topic, or at least it's easy to for people to ask follow-up questions about if they want to.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sketchnoting</b>: People (including most of the ones who don't identify as geeks) tend to be curious about my sketchnoting, since it's visual, easy to understand, and uncommon. That said, I need to get better at handling the usual follow-ups. People tend to say things like "You draw so well" or "I could never do something like that." I want to nip that in the bud and get people to realize that they can do this too. Pointing out that I draw stick figures like a 5-year-old doesn't seem to do the trick ("Ah, but you know what to leave out" and "But you're doing this while listening - that's hard"). Maybe a little humour, poking fun at the idea of going to an art school that specializes in stick figures or learning how to not fall asleep in presentations? About one in fifty people I talk to recognizes this as something they do on their own or that they want to do, and it's good to link them up with the global community. For most people, though, I feel slightly more comfortable focusing on ideas they want t olearn more about and sending them sketchnotes if there's a fit.
</p>

<p>
<b>Semi-retirement</b>: This experiment with semi-retirement can be a good conversational hook for prompting curiosity. It usually follows this sequence: semi-retired -&gt; "aren't you a little young? what do you mean?" -&gt; tracked, saved up, experimenting. It tends to be too detached from people's lives, though - many people don't think they can pull it off, even experienced freelancers who are doing most of it already.
</p>

<p>
<b>Variety</b>: If I don't know how someone identifies, it's fun to answer the "What do you do?" question (which tries to pigeonhole someone into a neatly understandable job title) with a sense of variety: "I do a lot of different things! This week, I &#x2026;" 
</p>

<p>
<b>Going forward</b>
</p>

<p>
For the next few events, I think I'll experiment with doing the tech/non-tech/non-geek identification earlier, or going into that with an opening based on variety. I could name an example each for tech, non-tech, and non-geek, and see which one they dig into. As for digging into people's interests, maybe an open-ended survey-type question would be an interesting way to help people open up while still collecting data in case people haven't thought about how to make themselves easier to get to know. Hmm&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Small talk might be small, but if I have thousands of conversations over the years, I might as well keep learning from it. How have you tweaked how you do small talk?

<h3 id="sec-12-2">I like being introverted&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<span class="tag"><span class="snippets">snippets</span></span></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">
<p>
Sometimes people tell me that they can’t believe I’m introverted. You
organize meetups, they say. You share a lot online. You can’t possibly
be introverted. Not only do I need to recharge after conferences or
other intense social interactions, I like being introverted – it’s
good to be comfortable with yourself. That said, you learn a lot when
you bump into other people, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to
have more of those serendipitous conversations.
</p>

<p>
I like group conversations more than one-on-ones because I get to
learn from the intersections of people’s interests. I see different
aspects of people than I might bring out on my own. Group
conversations also reduce the pressure to carry the conversation
myself – people bring their own questions and tips and ideas to the
table.
</p>

<p>
I’m particularly interested in virtual meetups because there are so
many wonderful people out there whom I will probably never be in the
same city with. Toronto is a great meetup city because there’s always
something going on, but there’s no reason why knowledge-sharing should
be unnecessarily privileged or limited by geographic proximity. If
people are curious about blogging, drawing, Emacs, Quantified Self, or
whatever we have in common, maybe we can have virtual show-and-tells
instead of relying on the probability of finding critical mass for a
meetup in our own areas.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;
I get my energy from a quiet and simple life. I’ve learned to say no
when I need more space: no if I need quiet instead of networking (even
if there could be someone who could change my life or vice versa just
over there); no if I need silence instead of a taxi cab conversation;
no to people’s requests in favour of spending time with W- or on my
own projects.
</p>

<p>
It’s hard to learn how to say no, or even to learn that you can. “Say
yes to everything,” the advice goes. Seize the day. Grab those
opportunities.
</p>

<p>
But there’s a lot of power in being able to listen to your needs and
carve out the time and space that you need—to meet the world on your
own terms, and to be happy to give because you’re ready to do so.

<h3 id="sec-12-3">Hacking my way into meeting people</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-3">
<p>
I try to minimize the number of things I’ve promised to other people
so that I have the flexibility to follow opportunities when they come
up. Conversations are an exception. It’s hard to not schedule those if
I want to make sure they happen at some point. Left to my own devices,
I might never get around to talking to people. So I pay someone a
small amount to handle my scheduling, which neatly removes me from the
back-and-forth hassles of coordinating times and also (useful and
possibly more important!) prevents me from giving myself excuses not
to do it. Then I remind myself that getting to and from these
appointments is either reading time or free exercise (for in-person
meetings), or possible podcast or blog material (if online). Introvert
hack. =)

Still, with thousands of plugins available on <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins</a>, there are always more ways to make blogs better. (Come to think of it, I should probably add a SEO-focused plugin too. <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> seems popular&#x2026;) Hope this list of favourites helps!

The weather finally warmed up last weekend. W- and I raked the back
yard, and I started planting seeds that would likely survive just in
case we get another frost. Spinach, peas, lettuce&#x2026; I don't know how
well the seeds will do, but I want to get things growing again. I
can't grow anything indoors because the cats love nibbling on greens,
so I'll just have to buy my tomato and basil starts from the garden
centres. In the meantime, though, I can experiment with seeds.
</p>

<p>
The soil feels better now than the sandy mix we started with, although
there's always room for improvement. We've added lots of compost to it
over the years &#x2013; mostly manure, but there was a year that <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/06/hungry-hungry-compost-and-other-garden-updates/">our compost
heap was active enough to steam</a>. <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=9ffed187c3b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=b31d433112b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextfmt=default">Toronto gives away leaf compost</a> every
Saturday, so we might check that out too. We're thinking about
ordering compost in bulk this year instead of getting bagged manure
from the store. I'll probably put in the compost around the time that
we clear out the peas and get started with tomatoes, so I can get some sprouts going while waiting to sort all of that out.
</p>

<p>
What am I going to change this year? Here are my notes from October 2013:
</p>

<a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/10/gardening-plans-for-2014/"><img src="http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Gardening-notes_thumb.jpg" alt="Gardening notes" /></a>

<p>
I changed my mind about irrigation. I think I'll start by
hand-watering the plants. It's not that hard to do, and I've marked
the rows a little more clearly now so I know what to expect. I
probably won't pay for a landscaping or gardening company. Maybe I can
share more notes on our garden and ask folks for tips. I'm looking
forward to growing more greens and herbs, and giving bitter melon yet
another shot.
</p>

<p>
I planted the first batch of seeds this weekend, going through many of the leftover seeds from 1-2 years ago. After all, the seeds aren't going to get any fresher, so I may as well plant them and see what sticks. Some of them germinate in a week, so let's see if there'll be any progress. 
</p>

<p>
Yay growing things! (Well, eventually. =) )

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-9">
<p>
Saturday afternoon. It had started raining, so W- put away his tools and stopped working on the deck stairs. He asked if I wanted to go out and do something fun – maybe watch a movie, or have pho? 
</p>

<p>
I checked the movie listings. Nothing particularly worth watching on the big screen instead of on our television, and we had food in the fridge. So we stayed home, watched one of the movies we’d checked out from the library, and enjoyed some home-made pizza.
</p>

<p>
We haven’t been to a movie theatre in ages (ever since I decided that actually, even superhero blockbusters are just fine on the small screen). The library is the source of a constant stream of DVDs. While there are long waits for the latest releases, there are plenty of old movies we can go through. I’ve gotten accustomed to watching with subtitles and the ability to pause or rewind, which is great since many movies involve at least one mumbly moment. Besides, if we watch at home, we can make jokes.
</p>

<p>
I am such a homebody. My default is to spend time at home, and I enjoy it. I love reading, writing, drawing, coding. Tidying up is slightly less fun, but it’s also useful. We’re not hermits – we go to the supermarket, the library, the hardware store – but we don’t often go out just for recreation.
</p>

<p>
I go out occasionally – more often than W- goes out. I go to the clients’ offices. I go to HackLab to hang out with other geeks and learn from them. I go to friends’ get-togethers. And then I come home and recharge.
</p>

<p>
Back when I lived at home, my parents took me and my sisters out a lot: eating at restaurants, strolling through the malls. I hardly go shopping here, aside from the occasional stressful sprint when I need to restock my shoes or clothes. I hardly go to restaurants, either. When I get together with friends, it’s usually in someone’s kitchen. 
</p>

<p>
I think the trick is to embrace it instead of wondering what other people are doing.

I need to go through the process of filing for a lost passport:

Since she doesn’t like taking classes or workshops, she can use that
time to get better at teaching herself. I don’t like taking classes
either, so I know what that’s like. I should probably hack my way
around that, though. There are many things that might be more cost- or
time-effective for me to learn in a class than on my own or from
books.

When I project my current paths out to their peaks, I learn a lot about where I want to go and how I want to get there. For example, I'm currently learning about sales by selling sketchnoting services. I'm starting with that because it's relatively easy to appreciate (yay visuals!), there are established companies in other geographies that have tested the business model and value proposition, and people want it. There's a lot of room to grow. If I imagine being a super-sketchnoter or a super-illustrator, though, I feel like there's something missing. I feel like the focus is on interpreting someone else's ideas instead of creating something marvelous and new. Artists create new things, and there's something fascinating in that.

A few of my friends want to learn more about cooking, going beyond eating out or occasionally making a bowl of pasta at home. It’s a welcome change, and I’m looking forward to more and more people making that shift. 
</p>

<p>
For some people, it seems a point of pride to not know how to cook: they’re too busy to sit down and do that, or there are so many good restaurants out there, or cooking is just plain not enjoyable. For us, cooking is part of our way of life. We can cook most meals for much cheaper than we can buy them, and our weekday meals are more convenient than eating out. I love being able to have my favourite foods at any time of day. Despite the occasional drudgery, I’ve grown to enjoy cooking – especially when W- and I spend a few hours putting together something delicious.
</p>

<p>
I thought I'd reflect on past 10 years of learning how to cook to see what I learned and how I learned it. When I started, I struggled with the basics: burning pancakes, trying to figure out how to use ground beef in different recipes. Now we can make lists based on the grocery fliers, adjust our plans based on what's marked down for quick sale, and stock our freezer with meals to last us through the week.
</p>

<h3>B.C. - Before Cooking</h3>

<p>
Growing up, I hadn't imagined being this comfortable with cooking. My sister was the cook in the family, the one with an intuitive sense of what went with what. She took whatever was in the fridge and made something delicious with it, no recipe required. We enjoyed the occasional meal she prepared for us, and she told us stories of how cooking helped her make friends while travelling. The rest of the time, we were spoiled by the fact that family business&#x2013;advertising photography&#x2013;retained a cook to feed clients, staff, and us.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't totally hopeless. I helped in the kitchen, and I loved making lasagna together with my mom. I took cooking lessons one summer. I mainly learned that following recipes produced reasonable results. At home, I occasionally made myself instant noodles or reheated pork and beans, but I didn't really have the motivation to cook.
</p>

<h3>Cook or Die</h3>

<p>
That changed a few months after I graduated from university. I had just turned twenty, and I was teaching computer science at my alma mater. To cut down on the commuting time, we found an apartment-style dormitory near the campus. Each unit was shared by two people, and there was an unfurnished kitchen. My parents outfitted it with a hot plate (a single electric burner, which was all the dormitory allowed), a toaster oven, a microwave, and a compact fridge. 
There were a number of fast food restaurants in walking distance that I'd frequented as a student, but I resolved that my grown-up life shouldn't involve KFC every lunch and dinner. There was a supermarket a bit of the way up the street. To force myself to learn how to cook, I decided that I would eat out for at most one meal a day. If I didn't cook, I'd go hungry. <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie/">Cook or die</a>. (Well, that was an exaggeration, but it was a good project name.)
</p>

<p>
Did I mention that my apartment didn't have Internet access? I know. Boggle.
</p>

<p>
It was&#x2026; interesting. I loaded up on kid- and singles- and microwave-oriented cookbooks, and occasionally made things up just as an experiment. You may find <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/category/cookordie/?order=asc">my blog posts from that time</a> amusing. Here's a summary of the first two weeks:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-1/">Day 1</a>: Hungarian sausages and pita pockets - not terribly appetizing, but edible enough. 
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-2-veal-sausage-and-potatoes/">Day 2</a>: I discovered that pita pockets are called pita <b>pockets</b> for a reason.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-3-more-sausages/">Day 3</a>: Figured out that pre-slicing the ingredients speeded up assembly.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-4/">Day 4</a>: Ate the same thing.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-5-more-sausages/">Day 5</a>: The remaining pitas were moldy. Discovered the power of freezing.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-6/">Day 6</a>: A respite! Leftovers from a restaurant. I used a microwave, so that sort-of counts as Cook or Die, right?
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-7-reheated-rice-sausage-slices/">Day 7</a>: More Hungarian sausages&#x2026;
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/cookordie-day-8-the-potato-misadventures/">Day 8</a>: A different kind of sausage. Also, potatoes.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/11/20031127-day-9-graduated-to-saucepan/">Day 9</a>: Graduated to using a saucepan.
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/12/day-10-more-ground-beef-salad/">Day 10</a>: Ground beef and salad?
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/12/day-11-20031204-late-entry/">Day 11</a>: Burritos - <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/12/w00t-hacked-the-ground-beef/">ground beef level up</a>!
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/12/burrito-attempt-flop/">Burrito flop. Boo.</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/12/breakfast-steak-potatoes/">Breakfast steak and potatoes</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2003/12/backlog-beef-beans-and-bacon-in-buns-20031210/">Beef, beans, bacon, buns</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see, I was a bit of a slow learner. ;)
</p>

<p>
Eventually I graduated to being confident enough in a few recipes that were ready for company. I was living in an exclusive girls' domitory, so no guys were allowed inside the units. That meant my friends could help me with groceries and give me tips, but they couldn't actually help me learn how to cook unless I was home for the weekend. The dormitory did have a garden with picnic tables and some shelter, though, and both male and female guests were welcome there. We worked out this weekly rotation, and I had dinner with someone practically every day. I particularly enjoyed being able to prepare individual-sized portions of lasagna rolls using the recipe in one of my microwave cookbooks. Even in pouring storms, friends would come and join me. It was wonderful.
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed teaching, but I left that to take advantage of a technical internship that the Japanese government was offering. In the in-between months, I stayed at home. In Japan, I stayed at a hotel-type dormitory with a cafeteria. There was hardly any cooking, although I did develop an appreciation for the sheer variety of ramen (instant or otherwise) available in Japan.
</p>

<h3>Graduate student life</h3>

<p>
When I moved to Canada for graduate school, I made sure I was in an apartment-style residence with a kitchen and a small shared living room. I shared my unit with three other people, and the mix changed each semester or so. There was a 24-hour supermarket within walking distance (somewhat expensive, but convenient) and other markets available a long walk or a short streetcar ride down the street. 
</p>

<p>
I made friends: some students who lived in the building, and other people I met in my studies or research. I often invited a couple of friends over for dinner, usually something experimental - a stir-fry, or chicken breast and sauce, or whatever recipe intrigued me. From time to time, I took advantage of the large common outdoor party/barbeque area.
At some point, I decided I was grown-up enough to want my own set of plates instead of the mismatched hand-me-downs, so I headed over to Walmart and splurged on a set of Corelle, a rice cooker, a teapot, and other essentials. 
</p>

<p>
There were occasional group cooking lessons in the residence, open to whoever signed up. I liked them. We split up into small groups and prepared different recipes such as roasted red pepper soup, and then we got to enjoy the tastes of all the recipes together.
</p>

<p>
The administration decided on the mix of roommates based on the questionnaires we submitted. I didn't always get along with my room-mates, one of whom tended to abscond with my dishes without returning them. (I lost a couple of cereal bowls this way.) When I had finished most of my research and lined up a job at IBM, I decided it was time to look for my own apartment. Of all the ones I looked at, my favourite was a one-bedroom apartment across the street. The rent was a little high and the kitchen was <i>tiny</i>, but I was looking forward to cooking without squabbling over fridge space or dishes in the sink.
</p>

<h3>Cooking with W-</h3>

<p>
I was a relative newcomer to Canada, so the building management didn't want to prepare a lease without a co-signer. Of all my friends, W- was probably the stablest and most respectable. He knew I managed my finances well and had the year's rent set aside, so he didn't have to worry about being on the hook for it. In preparation for the move, I'd boxed up my kitchen tools and resolved to live on peanut butter sandwiches like my mom had done in university. W- took pity on me and invited me over for dinner. These scrumptious home-made meals became a regular occurrence.
</p>

<p>
We signed the paperwork and moved my stuff (easy across the street, especially with a skateboard), I feathered my nest and set up my tiny kitchen. As a housewarming present, W- gave me Happy Bunny socks with witty slogans, since I'd mentioned my sister's trick of happy socks. As a kitchen-warming present, he gave me a basic set of Wusthof Classic knives. (Embarrassed by the generosity of the gift, I tried to talk him out of it, but he insisted that good tools make all the difference.)
</p>

<p>
They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Apparently, this is true for women too. Even though the paperwork was done, W- kept inviting me for delicious meals: crushing basil in a mortar and pestle for pesto, pinakbet (which he had learned how to make long before meeting me, so it was fun to encounter this familiar dish), a comparison of two lasagna recipes. I assisted, of course: chopping, stirring, learning more about cooking. Sometimes I invited W- or other people over to my place for whatever simple dishes I could prepare with my minimal kitchen setup; the knives made preparation a joy even in the cramped space. 
</p>

<p>
Eventually we realized we were in love. I sublet my apartment and moved in. I brought my cherished knives and selected kitchen tools, leaving the rest for my tenant.
</p>

<p>
After my tiny kitchen, W-'s kitchen was a real treat. Cast-iron skillets, a decent-sized wok, <i>two</i> rice cookers (large and small), a low-cost supermarket up the street, a garden to grow herbs in, a large kitchen table that we ended up spending most of our time at&#x2026; I volunteered to be the sous chef as often as I could. Over time, I took the lead in making more meals. I learned family favourites and we discovered new ones together. Cooking with W- made learning <i>fun</i> - we could celebrate successes and gamely finish anything that wasn't an absolute failure.
</p>

<p>
Cooking was part of W-'s way of life, and I was delighted to make it part of mine too. We rarely ate out. It just wasn't convenient during schooldays, and cooking was more frugal anyway. From March 2007 to August 2009 (30 months), I logged $145/month for groceries for 2.5 people (85%) and $25/month for dining out (15%). The actual numbers are different because W- picked up some groceries and usually treated me when dining out, although we set up this system where I contributed a fixed amount to household expenses so it worked out anyway.
</p>

<p>
We periodically tweaked the kitchen to improve the way we worked. We moved the canned goods from the basement into an industrial-style shelving unit. We moved the microwave to a custom shelf and freed up the rolling table it had been on, which turned out to have an excellent cutting surface on top of it - more counter space! Little tweaks like that made cooking more efficient and more fun.
</p>

<p>
I'd been reading about the benefits of a chest freezer on frugality blogs. We weren't sure if we had the space or if we could make it part of our lifestyle, so we dithered. In 2009, W- and I finally decided to take the plunge. We bought a 5.3 cu-ft freezer and started stocking it with sale items, filling the extra space with water jugs to improve efficiency. Eventually we learned the basics of bulk cooking, discovered which of our favourites froze well, and standardized our food containers for easier organization.
</p>

<p>
We also experimented with community-supported agriculture. It was a
good way to get through lots of vegetables, and Internet recipes were
really helpful. (All that zucchini! All that cabbage!) We eventually
decided to buy our own vegetables, but it was a good experience.
</p>

<p>
Now I've gotten to the point where a 30% markdown on pork tenderloin makes me think of tonkatsu, I can make a stir-fry with whatever vegetables look okay, and cooking is more like fun than a chore.
</p>

<h3>What I learned along the way</h3>

<p>
<b>People make cooking much more fun</b>
</p>

<p>
Cooking by myself was a drag. Cooking for other people was better, because we could enjoy the good stuff and laugh about the dishes that didn't go as well. (You can tell who your friends are - if they eat your experimental cooking, they're good friends!) Cooking <i>with</i> other people was the best, because then you can chat while chopping (carefully) and watch out for each other (looks like the eggs are done!). W- helped me learn so much more about cooking than I probably would have on my own.
</p>

<p>
<b>Good tools really do matter</b>
</p>

<p>
A sharp knife is less dangerous than a dull one because a sharp knife won't slip. W- periodically sharpens the knives, and I try to remember to use the steel before I use the chef's knife. I've also come to really appreciate the convenience of a dough scraper, Microplane graters, and other little kitchen things. That said, we try to minimize the number of unitaskers we have: no egg poachers, no slot toasters, no corn cob holders&#x2026; This means our drawers are easier to organize and keep uncluttered.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Internet is awesome</b>
</p>

<p>
The Internet has a gazillion recipes. I used to feel a little intimidated by the variety, but I realized that it meant that recipes are (mostly) just guidelines. Can I skip a spice that I don't normally stock? Can I substitute an ingredient for something I don't have? Do I want to adjust the temperature so that I can bake two different things at the same time? Chances are that someone has a recipe that calls for that, so it should be fine. It might not be amazing, but it will be okay.
</p>

<p>
<b>Absolute failures are very rare</b>
</p>

<p>
There was the time I put the yeast in water that was too hot. My lump of pizza dough didn't rise, and I had to throw it out and start over. Sometimes I burn things and have to scrape off bits. One time I was learning about seasoning cast-iron pans and I heated one for so long that the season flaked off. I broke a rice cooker and repaired it by replacing the thermal fuse. Most of my cooking failures were salvageable, though. It turns out that it's difficult to Completely Mess Things Up, so you should worry less and just go ahead and try it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Chest freezers and bulk cooking make everything easier</b>
</p>

<p>
Cooking in bulk lets us minimize the number of left-over ingredients, especially if we adjust the recipes. Having meals in the freezer is an amazing way to reduce the risk of cooking experimental recipes: if it's an absolute failure, well, there's a guaranteed meal all ready to go. Freezing is also great for dealing with leftovers. If I don't feel like eating the same thing for the rest of the week, I can package it as individual lunches in the freezer for when I feel like having it again.
</p>

<h3>Next steps for me</h3>

<p>
There's plenty more to learn, and I look forward to getting even better at this over the next ten years. Here are some of the skills that would be fun to improve:
</p>

<p>
<b>Regular menu planning and a broader repertoire of recipes</b>
</p>

<p>
You know how some households run on predictable patterns? We do a little of this: soups and baking on the weekends because of time-of-use electricity charges; stir-fries to take advantage of fresh vegetables from our grocery shopping; maybe a vegetarian meal sometime during the week&#x2026; It would be good to get even better at planning what we're going to have, perhaps based on a two-week cycle of themes that's adjusted by what's on sale, and to introduce new recipes within that framework.
</p>

<p>
<b>Recycling leftovers into new dishes</b>
</p>

<p>
I tend to be pretty happy eating the same thing again and again (or freezing the leftovers if they've been around a while), but recycling left-overs into new dishes would extend their fridge-life and encourage people to eat them. There are books that focus on cascading one recipe into another, and it seems like a good skill to learn. It's also a quick way to get more variety out of the same cooking effort.
</p>

<p>
<b>Working with different spices and sauces</b>
</p>

<p>
We have a lot of spices in the cabinet. I should make an inventory of them and organize them for easy reach. Sauces are also good ways to give the same basic dish different tastes. If I learn more about flavour, I can stock the freezer and fridge with a wider range of tastes.
</p>

<b>I stuff as much as possible into my blog</b> - it seems to have the only
notes that last. I have a shelf full of half-used paper notebooks.
I've lost text files with notes on hard drives that have long since
vanished. I've encrypted messages to myself and, years later,
discovered I hadn't kept the key around. (Duh.) My blog has my most
long-lived notes, having survived several transfers between blog hosts
and a few backups. I've probably gotten the hang of this "blog backup
and migration" thing, and I trust it more than I trust third-party
services like Evernote.

Thanks for signing up! I'm looking forward to sharing the things I've learned and to learning from you along the way. There's a lot of stuff on my blog, but I thought I'd start with an introduction:
</p>

<p>
<b>Hi, I'm Sacha Chua, and I'm interested in lots of things.</b>
</p>

<p>
It's a little weird to not have one of those "I'm a &lt;job title goes here&gt;" introductions, but I'm starting to get used to it. I'm in the middle of a 5-year experiment with semi-retirement, which is really an excuse for me to learn more about entrepreneurship, consulting, writing, drawing, coding, and all those other things that were hard to squeeze into evenings and weekends back in my corporate life. (I had really liked working with a big company and an excellent team, but I wanted to learn these other things too.)
</p>

<p>
I started this blog when I was in university as a way of taking notes and sharing what I was learning. It turned out to be a great way to learn from other people too. I hope it will help you, and I'm looking forward to discovering what we can learn together.
</p>

<p>
<b>What can you expect from me?</b>
</p>

<p>
You'll get weekly blog updates with links to the posts I've read in the past week and some interesting things I learned about elsewhere on the Internet. 
I post on my main blog daily, which can be a little overwhelming for people. But if you're an e-mail ninja or a feed reader fan, you can subscribe to the daily feed at <a href="http://feeds.sachachua.com/sachac">http://feeds.sachachua.com/sachac</a> .
</p>

<p>
Over the next few weeks, I'll also be sending you a few e-mails to help you find out about things you might like in my past posts. I might also write with the occasional question that I want to pick people's brains on before I write blog posts, maybe even with sneak previews of what I've been learning.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some stuff worth reading</b>
