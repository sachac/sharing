#+TITLE: Sharing Outline
This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!
https://github.com/sachac/sharing , http://sachac.github.io/sharing/

Does a topic here intrigue you, or can you think of some useful
follow-ups ? E-mail me at [[mailto:sacha@sachachua.com][sacha@sachachua.com]] (or
file an issue, if you're geeky that way ;) ).

Inspired by anything? Feel free to write your own posts, and send me a
link. =)

- *An approach for learning intermediate Emacs:* After you've gotten
  the hang of the basics, how can you keep learning more about using
  and tweaking this text editor? This will probably take different
  forms: small weekly tips for constant improvement, Emacs Lisp and
  Org Mode courses, and so forth.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to be an even better user of Emacs. I want to work more
    efficiently and fluently, and I want to have more fun with it too.
  - *Who might find it useful?* People who want to keep tweaking how
    they use Emacs. Mostly developers, but probably also writers and
    people interested in personal information management
  - *What is the change I want to help others with?* I want people to
    become confident about using Emacs for the long term. I want them
    to be able to play around with different mindsets/ideas, seeing
    the big picture instead of getting lost in lots of configuration
    details. I want to help people /think/ like an experienced Emacs
    user.
  - To do this, it would be good to read:
    - Archives of Emacs blogs (ex: the ones featured on
      http://planet.emacsen.org)
    - Manuals for Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and popular packages
    - the (small) collection of existing Emacs books
    - Related technical books for taking people beyond the beginner stage
    - Books about technical writing and learning design
    - Source code
  - What this book would be:
    - Different mental shifts/ideas, workflows; things people don't even think to search for
  - What this book is not:
    - How to write a package
    - Overloaded on specifics that will be obsolete or that are hard to get right for multiple platforms
  - Related

  - Possible titles
    - Emacs Mind
    - Thinking Like an Emacs Geek
    - ...

- *Think Like Emacs*
  - Why
    - What's the difference between a beginner Emacs user and an experienced one?
      - Beginner struggling with new concepts, frustrated with differences
      - Experienced Emacs users have a sense of where things are and how things fit together
    - In addition to learning new keyboard shortcuts and terms, you also need to make mental shifts
    - Invest time = compounding interest, long-term pay-off
    - As you become more comfortable with Emacs
    - You pick up new ways of thinking, aha!
    - Ideas for workflow as well
    - Community
  - Getting over the first barrier
    - Short-term learning challenge, long-term use
      - Other people are more interested in moving forward, I think
    - Keeping Emacs open, Emacsclient
    - Keyboard shortcuts; CUA, evil-mode, the Emacs Way
    - Terminology, glossary
      - Things that often trip people up

** Building your personal knowledge management system

- *A guide for creating your own personal knowledge management
  system:* I doubt that a one-size-fits-all solution will work, at
  least not with our current understanding. But I want to learn more
  about different approaches, I want to make mine totally awesome, and
  I want to help people build their own from the pieces that are
  already out there.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to have a wonderfully organized system that lets me easily
    capture, review, make sense of, and share what I know. I also want
    to have the vocabulary and concepts to be able to critically
    examine this system, spot gaps or opportunities for improvement,
    and make things better.
  - *Who would find this useful?* Fellow information packrats,
    writers, bloggers, self-directed learners
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Personal knowledge management and personal information management
    - Guides to using various tools
    - Information architecture
    - Library science
    - Writing and sense-making

** Self-directed learning and experimentation

- *Tips for self-directed learning and experimentation:* How to
  structure your time and learning, how to recognize and explore
  interesting questions, how to take notes, how to make sense of
  things, and so on. I want to learn more effectively, and I want to
  help other people learn more effectively too.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to be able to structure courses of study for myself, take
    great notes, build useful resources, and accumulate new knowledge.
  - *Who would find this useful?* Self-directed learners who want
    something more than online courses
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Quantified Self, experimentation
    - Note-taking and sense-making
    - Self-directed learning

** Working out loud
- *More notes on working out loud:* particularly addressing the
  excuses and barriers that get in people's way. To do this, it would
  be good to read about:
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to have a smooth workflow for learning and sharing. I want to
    have a wide network of people who can build on the stuff I'm
    learning about, and who get manageable updates that are scoped to
    their interests.
  - *Who would find this useful?* Individual practitioners interested
    in building their skills and network; social business advocates;
    bloggers who are also working on building personal insight and
    shared knowledge
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Social business, social learning, working out loud, personal
      learning networks, and personal knowledge management
    - Collaboration, team communication
    - Writing at work

** Visual thinking
- *Visual thinking:* particularly in terms of using it to clarify your
  thoughts, remember, and share. To do this, it would be good to read
  about:
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to be more fluent in using visual tools to explore thoughts
    and figure things out. I want to improve in terms of visual
    organization, technique, clarity, explanation, integration into my
    self-directed workflow, and so on.
  - *Who would find this useful?* People who've already started
    doodling (or who are picking up the hang of it) and who would like
    to use it for more things
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Mind mapping and other forms of visual organization
    - Sketchnoting
    - Planning
    - Blogging and other forms of personal publishing
    - Journaling
    - Information organization and sense-making

** Following the butterflies of your interest

- *Something about how to follow the butterflies of your interest*,
  because I rarely see this perspective in productivity books and
  because it's something other people might find helpful.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* I want to get
    better at going with the grain of my energy, doing what I want to
    do (and doing the work that helps me want what is good to want).
  - *Who would find this useful?* People with many interests -
    scanners, multi-potentialites, Renaissance-people-to-be.
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Career and life planning, especially unconventional paths
    - Productivity
    - Writing, note-taking
    - Psychology, cognitive limits, distraction

* Learning, writing, sharing knowledge, and constant improvement
** Personal knowledge management

*** OUTLINED How I learn: My learning and sharing workflow        :requested:
# <<learning-workflow>>
This outline can be found at http://sach.ac/outline#learning-workflow

        - Easier than Wordpress categories for me
        - Lets me notice when I've written a lot about a single topic
    - Planning ahead
- Sharing
    - Part of the learning process for me
        - I try to share as much as possible of what I learn, because otherwise I'll forget within a year
    - What to use when
        - Blog posts for searchability
        - Sketchnotes for shareability, or to make things friendlier
        - Tweets for short tips (also include in quick notes for weekly review)
    - Transforming my notes (see [[#transform-notes]])
    - Sometimes series of posts
- Next steps for me
    - Get better at re-ordering notes and filling in the gaps
    - Learn more about coaching and delegation as ways of speeding up my learning/sharing
    - Reorganize my index so that it's less chronological; suggest reading order?
    - Spend more time on editing, revising, and integrating so that the posts are even more useful

**** Learning more
  - Better: identify and make sense of relevant info; construct more knowledge (vs retrieving it)
  - Actually diving into documentation, experimentation, search
  - Learning from other people's thoughts
    - Do I usually jump to this state for non-technical stuff, or do I try to explore the question a little? It usually develops in a bit of a cycle
**** Tidying up my notes
  - Better: Balance between personal notes (to keep the sense of figuring things out) and tips for other people (to help people learn things quickly)
  - Very little of this, since I want to get stuff out there quickly
  - Trust that future Sacha will pull together
  - YAGNI / lazy organization
**** Planning
***** Before you learn something, plan how you're going to apply it

***** Learn faster by breaking skills down
**** Making sense
***** How to understand what you're thinking

***** Learn holistically by organizing your thoughts

**** OUTLINED Collecting my thoughts, organizing them, identifying gaps
  - fascinated by how nonfiction writers organize their notes
    - nonfiction, because fiction writers have to deal with a whole 'nother kettle of fish
  - Better: Quickly pulling things together, identifying uncertainties or gaps, non-linearly organizing notes into a logical flow
  - What are the key challenges?
    - Finding a specific thing
    - Seeing the overall picture

  - How do other people do it?
    - question by question; forward, or backward
    - Managing information overload, index, etc.
    - Scrivener, non-linear writing
    - Outlines
    - personal knowledge management
    - How to make a map of every thought
  - How do I do it?
    - Outlines
    - Links, blog posts, chunks
    - Good at small outlines; transform
    - Larger outlines sometimes sprawl, or I lose motivation
  - How
    - Sketch or blog post
    - Outline
    - Semi-linear, can be all over

**** OUTLINED Accumulating value

 How small steps can take you great distances

 - What do I want to add?
   - Dealing with excuses
   - Taking notes: how to take notes, how to review your notes

 Beginner: do I need to cover this? maybe in its own post, or if people ask

 - picking a good direction to go in
   - doesn't have to be a complete, detailed plan
   - rough direction, idea of good/better/best
   - I like imagining wild success
   - also see if you don't actually want it strongly enough
 - figuring out what a few good next steps are - people often struggle with breaking things down into small, doable steps
   - too big: I don't have the time
   - too vague: I don't know where to start
   - too small: I don't see how this will help me get there
   - just right: let's try it!
 - checking to see if you're still going in the right direction, tweaking plans
   - keep track of ideas and next steps
   - review your notes
   - following up

 Intermediate:

 - taking notes, so you don't have to keep rediscovering things you've forgotten
   - questions for reflection
     - what are you doing?
     - how are you doing it?
     - what are you learning?
     - what are the next steps?
   - tools
     - paper journal; write down the date. If you're working on several topics, you might consider having one small notebook per topic, or using an index. [[http://blog.highfivehq.com/posts/a-little-known-hack-from-japan-to-get-your-notebook-organized][tabs]], or number your pages and keep an index at the back of the notebook.
     - I like using Evernote because I can add notes using my phone or my computer
   - finding the time
     - do it while you're learning
     - "I am going to ..."
     - clarifies your thoughts
     - helps you deal with interruptions and dead ends

 Advanced:

 - *seeing the connections and patterns over time* <- probably worth a post, since I want to dig into this myself
   - why
     - celebrate your achievements
     - check your progress
     - look for gaps and opportunities
     - make sense and solidify your understanding
   - rereading your notes
   - this is not as easy as collecting them, I think
   - comparisons: before and after (ex: a year)
   - summarizing: timelines, outlines
 - teaching other people
   - explaining things in your own words
   - organizing small steps into bigger, more logical chunks
   - teaching specific people vs teaching in the abstract
 - sharing with people
   - because you could save someone out there a little time on that
     same little step too, and if you multiply that by a thousand
     people, that's a lot of value

***** Excerpt
 The book /[[http://earlyretirementextreme.com/ere-book][Early Retirement Extreme]]/ (Jacob Fisker - CreateSpace: 2010)

 #+begin_quote
 Intellectual goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to:
 - Be able to quickly prioritize the relevance of information and be able to quickly research and find relevant information in many different areas. Learn independently and have an interest in doing so.
 - Have enough generalized knowledge to be able to understand the information and put it into the context of a mental framework, a model or procedure, and use it to ask further questions.
 - Recognize which problems the model applies to, take the solution to one problem, generalize it, and apply it to another problem.
 - Be able to critically analyze the model, refine it, and combine different models to achieve an objective. Practice critical thinking in all aspects of life to reach a degree of rational certainty. Be open to new ideas but do not accept anything uncritically.
 - Synthesize interdisciplinary information and laterally connect similarities which are not immediately apparent, discovering new models and procedures.
 - Evaluate different methods, models, and procedures while effectively ranking them for utility, and picking the best one while recognizing the pertinence of other methods. Pursue relevant and correct knowledge persistently and consistently. Master the fundamentals.
 #+end_quote

 This! I want to get better at all of these things. Based on feedback
 from my clients, I do pretty well already, prioritizing requests and
 potential resources, quickly cobbling together a tool from different
 pieces, and connecting the dots.

 But what would even better look like, and how do I inch closer to
 that?

 The more you know--the broader and deeper relevant knowledge you
 have--the easier it is to learn, since you have more resources for
 understanding and remembering new information. So the more I read and
 the more I try, the easier it is to learn.

 Subskills:
 - Figuring out what's relevant
 - Making sense of things
 - Figuring out how the pieces fit together
 - Recognizing the right nail when you have a hammer

- Currently type ~108wpm on Dvorak
    - Type faster and rely on autocorrect and editing to fix errors?
    - Use speech recognition?
        - Easiest startup, extra benefits for dictating book notes and transcribing my own stuff
        - Highest frustration
    - Learn Colemak for same-hand optimization?
        - Closest to Dvorak in terms of how I use my computer
        - Because it's close, I get the most confusion; sigmoid curve?
        - Colemak FAQ says stick with Dvorak if you're already happy with it
        - Maybe I should play with this incremental approach? http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1684
        - Hah, maybe I should see about making my Dvorak home row close to
        - Big selling point of Colemak: similar to QWERTY, common shortcuts stay the same.
            - Emacs has different shortcuts anyway
            - and I've gotten used to where things are
            - and also, normal Ctrl-x, Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v suck because you get tempted to do them on the same hand
        - No
    - Learn Plover (stenography) and much higher WPM?
        - My keyboard doesn't handle some of the chords well
        - Phonetic, so...
    - Draw pictures instead (work on getting even better at communicating concisely?)
    - Bottleneck is not typing speed; improve thinking speed somehow?
- Three cases
    - Outlining
        - Uses a lot of keyboard shortcuts, so Dvorak or Colemak would be better than Plover or speech recognition

            - Computer
            - Paper
    - Turning an outline into a blog post
        - Current workflow involves a lot of editing and deleting, so speech recognition and Plover are less useful

 - Background
     - Grew up with a computer
     - Learned how to type long before I had computer or typing classes
     - Bad habits
     - One summer, I decided to learn Dvorak. dvorak7min
     - More than ten years ago
     - I type faster and more comfortably in Dvorak than in QWERTY.
     - Also, it keeps people off my laptop and adds to my reputation for geek weirdness.
 - Why
     - Curious about computer-based optimization
         - Rolls
     - Keep my brain flexible
     - Learn about learning
     - Possibly get faster?
         - Trade-offs
 - Nudged by http://kevinercia09.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/five-for-typing/

 - Experience
     - Install support for it
     - Try different typing tutors
         - http://www.learncolemak.com/ - basic, two characters
         - http://keybr.com - better interface
         - http://colemak.com/TypeFaster - working on this because the lessons are built in
 - Day 1 (Sept 20, 2013) - two hours
   - Went through the first six lessons of Learn Colemak (I still need to learn the bottom row)
   - Tried out keybr's random words level 1 - dismal 14wpm
   - 23wpm on lesson 1 for Type Faster - a slightly more encouraging 23wpm

** Writing / blogging / sharing knowledge
*** OUTLINED [#C] Balancing "useful" and "personal" on my blog
 Lower-priority: I can wait until it seems more likely that my balance will change, or I can transform this into a post about blog role models and getting closer

 - Good balance
 - What kind of balance do I want to have?
 - I'm thinking about this because this balance might change
 - As an introvert, I don't want to impose on other people
   - I'm somewhat okay with blog reading being completely voluntary
   - This is why I haven't gotten around to e-mail newsletters yet, even though reading is voluntary too.
   - Maybe I don't have to?
 - I want most of my posts to be *useful.*
 - I don't want to be generic. What's the point of writing something you could just find on Lifehacker? So I tell stories about what I'm learning.
 - What I want to avoid:
   - Article mills
   - Me-me-me-blah-blah-blah
 - But there are good examples
   - Lifehacker tends to be impersonal
   - The Simple Dollar is a little closer to the impersonal side of things, but is sprinkled with personal stories
   - Penelope Trunk and Mel Chua write more personally than I do
     - What makes their blogs feel more personal?
       - Penelope Trunk writes about more stresses and difficulties.
     - Mel's writing communicates her excitement and passion
   - Mr. Money Mustache is a great mix of useful + personal.

*** Other post
 Also, another note from 2004: My notes were shorter and more plentiful
 back when I didn't think of it as a blog, just my notebook. That could
 be handy to bring back. But I like the depth of exploring an idea in a
 longer post, and I like the way sketches help me build up to more
 complex ideas too. Perhaps a tidbits category that's not included in
 the stream, a combination of a web log and features à la BoingBoing
 (although not as awesome)? One thing I've learned in the past ten
 years is that if it isn't public, it's hard to remember or keep.

 # <<blogging-skills>>
 [[http://sach.ac/outline#blogging-skills]]

 Here's my evolving break-down of blogging-related skills, including
 notes for future blog posts. I'm currently working on getting better
 at *outlining* (from high-level down to chunks of ~100 words)
 and *synthesizing* (especially combining other people's insights with
 my experiences). I'm using this outline to think of ways to
 deliberately practise certain aspects of blogging, to plan posts that
 will help people learn, and to clarify what I would like to delegate
 to assistants or work with coaches for.

     - What happens if I spend four or more hours on a blog post? :TODO:
     - New superpower - I can take more time to do things than I used to.
         - Cooking. Reading.
         - And it pays off.
     - Also why: too much
     - Spending /more/ time on each blog post
         - Why? It's not just a blog post, it's the learning
         - No time pressures anyway
             - I've written far enough ahead that I'm not worried about running out of posts any time soon
             - I'm surrounded by ideas
         - I don't want to write a massive, useful, linkbait post that disappears from my brain after I write it. Like cramming for a school exam and then moving on.
     - What can I improve?
         - Filter through lots more material
         - Link to more resources; compare
         - Touch a post more often

         - Outline helps a lot with that.
             - It was hard to do this before outlining because I couldn't see and manage my drafts as well.
         - Easy for me to track, especially if I'm writing it in Emacs.

     - Four hours is around the time I usually take to plan a presentation

         - What do I want people to remember or act on
         - What do I need to share to help them get from A to B
         - Illustrations

     - Oh, maybe that will be my reason to split off sub-blogs
         - If I wrote like other people
             - I would include less "I" and more "You", giving people advice
             - I would emphasize the categories more

*** OUTLINED Think about your blogging goals and how your posts align with them :data:

    :END:

 I've been thinking about my goals for blogging because I want to get better. I write almost every day, fueled by habits of reading and experimenting. I have time to learn things, and I can learn more effectively if I learn deliberately. Here's what I'm learning about being clear about your goals and analyzing how your actions match up with them.

**** 1. Clarify your goals

 It's good to know what your goals are and how the different approaches serve those goals so that you can choose the ones that are the most effective. You can also look at each approach to see how you can improve it.

 After some reflection, I came up with this list of goals for my blog:

     1. Learn more effectively by thinking through complexity or explaining what I'm learning
     2. Explore assumptions and possibilities; become more aware of them myself, and help other people see them
     3. Improve core skills through practice: making decisions, explaining ideas, organizing thoughts, etc.
     4. Save myself and other people time spent re-solving the same problems or learning the same things
     5. Build a long-term archive that I can use to remember what I'm learning and see differences over time
     6. Learn from other people through questions, comments, and conversations

 Your list of goals will probably look different. Many people have goals such as building a business by promoting their products or services, educating clients or readers, keeping family members up to date, working through difficult issues by writing anonymously, and so on. Take a moment to think about and prioritize your goals.

 If you're having problems expressing your goals, you can also take a look at your recent blog posts and ask yourself, "Why did I write this?" What results did you want to get? What purpose did it serve? One blog post might work towards several different goals.

**** 2. Analyze the ways you approach those goals

 Different actions support different goals to different extents. Think about the different types of blog posts you write. Score them against each of your goals on a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 5 means that type of post helps a specific goal a lot, while 1 means it does very little or even nothing for that particular goal.

 Here are some of the types of posts I share and how they line up with the goals I listed above:

     |                                                     | Goal 1: Learn | Goal 2: Explore | Goal 3: Improve | Goal 4: Save time | Goal 5: Build | Goal 6: Learn from others | Total |
     |-----------------------------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+---------------------------+-------|
     | T1: Draw original stuff                             |             5 |               5 |               5 |                 5 |             5 |                         3 |    28 |
     | T2: Draw book reviews and events                    |             5 |               2 |               5 |                 5 |             5 |                         5 |    27 |
     | T3: Think out loud                                  |             5 |               5 |               5 |                 1 |             5 |                         3 |    24 |
     | T4: Share tech tips, troubleshooting notes, or code |             5 |               5 |               3 |                 4 |             2 |                         4 |    23 |
     | T5: Review longer spans of time (yearly, decisions) |             5 |               4 |               5 |                 1 |             5 |                         3 |    23 |
     | T6: Write tips that few other people can cover      |             4 |               2 |               3 |                 3 |             4 |                         3 |    19 |
     | T7: Write tips that other people can also cover     |             3 |               1 |               2 |                 2 |             2 |                         2 |    12 |
     | T8: Review recent posts (weekly, monthly)           |             1 |               1 |               4 |                 1 |             4 |                         1 |    12 |
   #+TBLFM: $8=vsum($2..$7)

 Sorting the table by the total score makes it easy to see which approaches you value more. If some goals are much more important to you than others, you can also weight those goals in your calculations. For example, if building a long-term archive was twice as important to me, I could double that column when calculating the total score.

 Anyway, this ranking makes it clearer why I feel good about original drawings and sketchnotes, and why I skew towards decision reviews and "thinking through things"-type posts even if they don't feel focused enough on saving other people time. Most of the blogging advice tends to focus on writing tips, but they don't motivate me as much.

 How about you? Do your post types match up with your goals? Are there clear winners that you should focus on? You can write lower-value posts from time to time because they address different needs. For example, I post weekly reviews because they're useful to me even if they're less useful for others.

**** 3. Adjust your priorities based on feedback

 Of course, since these values are subjective, it helps to adjust them based on your website analytics or feedback from your readers. For example, if you think a type of post saves people a lot of time, you'll probably see a lot of visits or comments on it. If you have Google Analytics, you can export the *Content - Site Content - All Pages* table to a spreadsheet, classify the top X links, and then see what types of posts people spend their time on. For example, I analyzed the top 500 pages visited in July 2013, classified each by type, calculated average views and time per page, and sorted it by average views to get a sense of which posts tend to be more popular.

 | Post type                  | Number of pages | Number of views | Average page views per page | Average minutes per page view | Average bounce rate |
 |----------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+---------------------|

 | T6: write tip (few)        |              41 |            1392 |                          34 |                           3.1 |                 72% |
 | T8: review                 |               9 |             283 |                          31 |                           1.0 |                 61% |
 | T7: write tip (many)       |              24 |             461 |                          19 |                           4.7 |                 73% |

 My sketchnotes are more popular by far. My technical notes are surprisingly durable over time, even though you'd expect them to be superseded by bugfixes, technical changes, better documentation, and so on. Posts as old as 2004 still turn up. Because people still get a lot of value from my old tech posts, I adjusted the "Save time" rating for tech tips from my original value of 3 to 4. (I had started with a lower value because I figured that not a lot of people would probably have run into the same issues I did, but it turns out that time makes up for audience size and the long tail works.) As I expected, tips that few other people have written about get more pageviews than tips that more people have written about, although I'm surprised that people tend to spend more time on the common tips. My "thinking out loud" posts are more popular than I expected. (Limitations: This only looks at single-page views in a single month.) Also, people tend to click on my weekly reviews if I add a brief description to the title, so that's something.

 Anecdotally speaking, I get a lot of comments and links to my sketchnotes. I'm also delighted by the conversations that occasionally grow out of the "thinking out loud" posts, and how sometimes people will share even better solutions when I post my technical notes.

**** 4. Identify ways to improve each approach

 Now that you've looked at what makes each type of post different, you can focus on how to improve each type by building on its strengths or compensating for its weaknesses. Here's what I'm planning for the kinds of posts I write:

 *Draw original stuff*: It takes me 2-4 hours to make one of these. I like making technical notes (ex: Emacs), sketchnote tutorials (to help people draw more), and other drawings related to life and planning. I'm getting used to drawing them with less up-front planning. Even though I end up moving things around, I think it's useful to just get started. Drawing involves a trade-off because images are not as searchable as text. I can fix that by including the text, but it's a little awkward and it takes more time. Still, people like the drawings a lot, and I like them too.

 *Draw book reviews and events:* I go to fewer events these days, but I'm reading a lot more books. It takes me two hours to read a typical business book in depth, drawing notes along the way. I tend to draw book reviews only when I've already gotten a sense that a book is worth reading in depth. One way to increase my frequency is to draw book notes based on the skimmed parts of books that I'm not reading deeply - perhaps breaking out just the chapter or idea that resonates with me, and using that to illustrate a blog post reflecting on it. I can also work on getting more high-quality books into my pipeline, or practise by drawing more books with fewer value judgments.

 *Think out loud:* I can improve the "Save time" score by stashing the notes in my outline, adding observations, until I've fleshed it out enough for preliminary findings and advice. It means that the output will be more concise in its reasoning and I'll have to do more learning on my own instead of opening up the conversation early, but then the posts will be useful for other people as well as for me. [[http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/][Mr. Money Mustache]] is a good example of a blog that mixes personal stories and useful observations. The main thing that was holding me back from doing this before was losing track of my drafts, but my outline is a good step.

 For example, this post started as a rough outline, thinking out loud about what kinds of posts I wanted to write. Now I'm going back and filling it in with other information that might be useful for people. If it ends up too long, I might have to trim it. We'll get there!

 *Share tech tips, troubleshooting notes, or code:* The limiting factor here is that I'm not working on any professional projects that I can write about, so I'm forced to run into and resolve fewer issues. I can replace that with working on my own projects or on open source projects, or helping people with questions. I often tweak or work on things related to Emacs, Wordpress, or data visualization, so there's that. If I set aside time and find a good source of small bugs so that I can ease my way into a habit of contributing to open source again, then that will also help me with my life goal to keep my technical skills sharp.

 *Review longer spans of time:* I can increase the frequency of decision reviews by scheduling them so that I don't lose track of items. Because I manage my outline in Org Mode, that should be relatively easy to do. I can also bootstrap this by reviewing last year and last decade's monthly reviews (if available), or the blog posts if not. I have an advantage here because I have a lot of public notes over the years.

 *Write tips that few other people can cover:* There are lots of information gaps to fill. Sometimes it's because people don't have the time, inclination, or confidence to write about something. Sometimes it's because I have a useful combination of skills or I can bring a different perspective. If I can't find information, that's a good reason to write it.

 *Write tips that other people can also cover:* The world doesn't really need another "how to find the time to blog" tutorial. If I can filter through search results for a good one and make it more findable, that beats writing one from scratch--unless I can add something special or relate different types of advice to each other.

 *Review recent posts (weekly, monthly):* These are low-value in the short term (mostly lists of links, plus the nudge to do my weekly planning process), but I've found them to be surprisingly useful over the years. They also help keep my large blog archive manageable. That's why I keep posting them. I've started using the weekly and monthly reviews to give people [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/how-i-use-feedburner-to-give-people-the-option-of-different-blog-update-frequencies/][less-frequent subscription options]] (daily can be a little overwhelming), so that's helpful too.

**** Wrapping up

 "Get better" is a vague goal. If you can identify the specific goals you would like to work toward, different ways to move towards those goals, and specific actions you can take to improve those approaches, you'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of growing. You'll find it easier to recognize or create opportunities to grow, and you can track your progress along the way. You might also be able to identify counter-productive approaches and replace them with ones that move towards more of your goals. Good luck and have fun!

 /Objectives for this post/
 - Be more effective at outlining my blog posts
 - Help other people improve their writing
 - Share a list of things I'd like to write about

 - Breaking skills down into their components
     - Writing -> learning

 - Why outlining?
     - Pseudocode and prototypes
     - Some moments of discipline to keep fleshing things out
     - More about the freedom to make slow and steady progress, knowing
       that a plan keeps me roughly on track
     - Freedom to cut and rearrange
 - What I'm doing
     - Tracking outlining time separately; butt-in-chair time
     - Sharing my outline
     - Tracking versions
 - Tools
     - Org Mode workflow
         - Outline
         - Lists
         - Navigation
             - C-c j (org-goto) to jump around
         - Filtering
             - C-c v (org-show-todo-tree) shows the ones that have been
               marked with a status (good to see which ones I've outlined)
             - Tags
         - Refiling?
         - Publishing and archiving
     - Github
 - Imagining wild success
     - Outline of things I want to share
     - The feel for how things flow together
     - People can easily review the outline - maybe with org-info?
     - People can tell me what they're interested in - maybe with a way
         for me to note who I should follow up with, but in a way that
         doesn't require me to keep a private repository? Maybe tied in
         with e-mail...

 Get "Thinking on Paper" first?

*** OUTLINED Update: What I want my blog to become

 - I took a month off from my two-days-a-week consulting gig so that I
   could experiment with focusing on writing.
 - I want to be all-the-way-retired. There's a chance I might be. I'm
   not sure.
 - Most writers don't even have this luxury: to write about whatever
   they want to write, without worrying about whether the book will be
   picked up by a publisher or whether the magazine will accept the
   article.


 - The M word: Monetization
     - I thought about what I would use more money to do
       http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/on-blogging-and-platforms-and-experimenting-with-google-hangout/
         - I wouldn't change my lifestyle all that much
         - More money would probably be split between
             - more experiments
             - and buying more time to spend with family and friends
     - Probably won't need to put a lot of effort into marketing and
       building an audience
         - Reasons to go out there
             - Can save other people time?
             - Can learn from other people?
             -
 - So this is what's going to happen for as long as I can do it.
     - I'm going to learn lots of things.
         - Curious
         - What people ask me about
         - From time to time, I may even dust off my outlines for future
           books
         - but I'd rather publish things bit by bit
         - Eventually I'll get good enough at writing from outlines (or
           slotting things back into them) that I can put together larger
           resources, like articles and books

*** Writing into the differences

 - What do I do differently?
     - Learning, writing, visual notetaking, sharing knowledge, and constant improvement
     - Planning, deciding, and tracking
     - Personal finance, semi-retirement, cooking, frugality, and household life
*** Stuff that works for me

 - Writing works better than interviews or speaking
     - Outlines, links
     - Even though I say a lot more words in an interview
     - Things I like about interviews
         - Other people's questions
         - Back and forth
         -

*** Return on time                                                     :data:

 It took me around two hours each to create the two images in http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/09/how-to-learn-emacs-keyboard-shortcuts-a-visual-tutorial-for-newbies/

 It took me four hours to create http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/how-to-learn-emacs-a-hand-drawn-one-pager-for-beginners/

 It takes me about two hours to read a business book in depth, creating a visual summary on the go.

 Sketching a 1-hour talk generally takes 2-4 hours, including time to get there and a schedule that usually includes networking.

 Shorter talks tend to be lighter-weight unless they've been rigorously planned and rehearsed.

 - One post a day, unless I'm sketchnoting an event or I'm super-excited
 - Share A Draft and Editorial Calendar
 - makes it possible to spread posts out while giving people links to the resource
 - Windows Live Writer doesn't pick up the date, so I need to make sure I set the date again

*** Blogging advice that I'm not planning to follow
 - keyword optimization
 - e-mail list
 - linkbait
 - RSS feed summaries
 - summaries on front page
*** Blogs and e-mail newsletters

 - conversation with Timothy Kenny, who has just started experimenting with daily e-mail newsletters
 - I suggested public archive

 - http://www.productiveflourishing.com/why-i-was-so-worked-up-about-killing-my-newsletter/#utm_source=feedly

 - I've been thinking about e-mail newsletters because Timothy Kenny
   has just started with his.
 - Typical advice for growing and (dare I say it?) monetizing your
   blog.
   - Offer an incentive for people to sign up for your mailing list.
     - PDF
     - exclusive content
   - Put people on an autoresponder.
   - Mail people regularly to build the relationship
     - Sell them stuff later on
 - I don't even send friends or family e-mail normally
   - Hmm, maybe I'm not used to the grammar of it?
 - also, it takes me an average of 6 minutes to reply to an e-mail.
   - Oddly,
 - RSS is mostly dead. Only geeky people use it. [[blog-subscribe][outline]]
 - Automatic e-mail newsletters
 - I want to sell things only if they save you a lot of time
 - Forget that. I want to give away so much that you almost feel
   obliged to help.
   - and since I don't need that much money for my lifestyle (I think)
 - I'm very good at planning inexpensive experiments. Besides, that
   makes it easier for other people to replicate.


 Why: because there are people who send e-mail, but don't blog

 - why don't they blog?
   - self-conscious: only the "best content" out there
 \

*** Blogging excuse-buster: I don't want to blog because I want to put my best foot forward

 This is something I hear a lot from people. "I don't want to blog
 because I might be embarrassed."

*** Thoughts on growing an audience
 - Sometimes I wonder if I should do more of the "Right Things" when
   it comes to building a blog.
     - Focus on one or two topics so that people will subscribe because
       you're consistent and reliable.
     - Research keywords so that you can optimize for search engines
       queries and write content that will bring people in.
     - Reach out to new audiences with guest posts.
     - Send e-mail newsletters so that you can build relationships and
       so that you can sell to people later on.
 - Why
     - Can save other people time
     - Can learn from more people
     - Scale up - create more value for each unit of time I invest
 - Sometimes I'm envious of blogs with hundreds of comments. On sites
   like that, people learn a lot from each other, not just me. But I
   remember that reading and responding to comments takes time, and I'd
   want to filter through them for spam, and that other people glaze
   over when they see pages and pages of comments and end up not
   reading them. It's okay. I like the in-depth conversations we have
   in comments. I'm not entirely sure if I'm sour-graping, but it seems
   to make sense.
 - Sometimes I wonder if this should be more like other blogs. But then
   that's a well-travelled path, with lots of other people exploring
   it. I have this amazing opportunity to try something different. I
   should.
 - Actually, I already know what I should do--what works for me, what
   I should do more.
     - The enduring posts on my blog are either tech notes (Emacs,
       Drupal) or sketches.
 - The clearer my "no", the less I'm distracted from the things that I
   can do.
 - Like the way I hack around my introversion
     - Write about whatever I'm learning about - variety of interests, and
       let more focused people use search results and category links
     - Look at other people's questions and failed search results to
       nudge me to write about certain topics if I'm curious about them
       too
     - Read good blogs and write about what inspires me, linking.
       Invite people who don't have blogs to share their tips and
       lessons learned on mine.
     - Build relationships through comments. Give away as much as I
       can of what I know. Let people show their appreciation if they
       want to. Money is nice, but there are other ways too.
 - Risks in getting too big
     - Internet has a seamy underside
 - Introvert
 - The time I would spend in pitching guest posts, etc.
     - versus making things

 - Drawing
     - Nearly 39,000 people visited in May, when I published
     - Plenty of blogs
     - Lots of infographics
     - Not that many useful, non-marketing drawings
 - It's okay

 - Are there low-effort, high-benefit things I can do to make this better?

     - Might get to the point where people are learning from each other
         - You can do this elsewhere on the Internet
         - So it would have to be a particularly interesting
           combination of people

 I miss teaching. I had tons of fun teaching computer science when I
 was in the Philippines, coming up with different analogies and
 exercises.

 Stephanie Diamond suggested making a sketchnotes course on Udemy.
 People have asked me about teaching Emacs, or blogging, or Quantified
 Self tracking and analysis.

 - What would you want to learn for free?
 - What would you value at $49?
 - What would you value at $99?

 Help me figure out a good curriculum that could help you!

*** It's okay to be wrong
 At an applied rationality meetup in Toronto, the guest speaker
 confessed to being afraid of blogging because she didn't want to be
 pinned down to words.

 People think of writing as final. The fuzziness of conversation in
 memory might let you argue, "That's not what I said," but writing
 leaves you no wiggle room.

 It's okay to be wrong.

*** Embracing the resistance in terms of writing
 The resistance is a symptom that you're on the right track. /The
 resistance is not something to be avoided; it's something to seek
 out./ ... The artist sees out the feeling of the resistance and then
 tries to maximize it. The cog, the day laborer, the compliant
 student--they seek to eliminate the feeling instead.

*** OUTLINED Thinking about a virtual meetup for sketchnoters
- Kevin Dulle organizing tweetchats
- It would be great to go over different techniques
- Finding speakers is always a challenge
- But it's a great learning experience, so even if I sketch out a
  "curriculum" and prepare many of the talks, that's fine.
- Also, people can always step forward and volunteer.

  - Experiment with Google Hangout
*** DRAFTED How to get started with sketchnoting  :one-pager:
Draw this

1. Take notes
- Why

2. Take hand-written notes

3. Slow down and write legibly
   You don't have to write everything
   Leave yourself space, then come back and fill things in later
   A good ink helps: find one that's readable and doesn't smear
   Tip: stash pens everywhere so that you're never without one!

4. Emphasize important concepts
   Boxes, highlighter, color pencils, etc
   (Test the highlighter - sometimes ink can get messed up!)

5. Use simple shapes.
   Star - important point
   Box, check - TODO
   Arrow - next step
   Speech bubble - quote
   Thought cloud - what you were thinking
   Lightbulb - idea

   Make rough copies of diagrams

6. Have fun by drawing faces. This is a surprisingly good way to
   remember an event, and it's also a good way to settle in if you're
   early. (Being early is great for grabbing good seats.)

   Write down the topic title and the speaker name, then spend a few
   minutes sketching the person's face. You can start with a simple
   rectangle with roughly the right proportions. Hair style? Glasses
   or eyes? Nose? Facial hair? Smile? Doesn't have to be perfect.

7. Draw other icons. People often repeat themselves or say things you
   don't have to write down, so you can doodle during those parts.
   Draw simple images related to what people are talking about. (Or
   draw things that are completely unrelated - up to you!) Listen for
   visual metaphors and try to draw them. Leave yourself space, and
   then come back and doodle when you have time.

*** Planning a sketch on index cards

*** Printing sketchnotes
I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.

Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a

I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.

Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder...

How to listen and draw at the same time


When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!
