#+TITLE: Sharing Outline
This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!

Does a topic here intrigue you, or can you think of some useful
follow-ups ? E-mail me at [[mailto:sacha@sachachua.com][sacha@sachachua.com]] (or
file an issue, if you're geeky that way ;) ).

Inspired by anything? Feel free to write your own posts, and send me a

Draw this

1. Take notes
- Why

2. Take hand-written notes

3. Slow down and write legibly
   You don't have to write everything
   Leave yourself space, then come back and fill things in later
   A good ink helps: find one that's readable and doesn't smear
   Tip: stash pens everywhere so that you're never without one!

4. Emphasize important concepts
   Boxes, highlighter, color pencils, etc
   (Test the highlighter - sometimes ink can get messed up!)

5. Use simple shapes.
   Star - important point
   Box, check - TODO
   Arrow - next step
   Speech bubble - quote
   Thought cloud - what you were thinking
   Lightbulb - idea
   
   Make rough copies of diagrams

6. Have fun by drawing faces. This is a surprisingly good way to
   remember an event, and it's also a good way to settle in if you're
   early. (Being early is great for grabbing good seats.)

   Write down the topic title and the speaker name, then spend a few
   minutes sketching the person's face. You can start with a simple
   rectangle with roughly the right proportions. Hair style? Glasses
   or eyes? Nose? Facial hair? Smile? Doesn't have to be perfect.

7. Draw other icons. People often repeat themselves or say things you
   don't have to write down, so you can doodle during those parts.
   Draw simple images related to what people are talking about. (Or
   draw things that are completely unrelated - up to you!) Listen for
   visual metaphors and try to draw them. Leave yourself space, and
   then come back and doodle when you have time.

** Printing sketchnotes
I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.

Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a

I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.

Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder...

How to listen and draw at the same time


When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!

** OUTLINED Emacs newbie: Tips for learning keyboard shortcuts

The tutorial (C-h t) is useful and well worth going through several times. Getting used to marking a region with C-SPC versus using shift- takes some doing, but it’s really quite powerful once you get the hang of it – mainly because you can then use all sorts of navigational commands without getting RSI.

Incidentally, you may want to look into mapping your Caps Lock to Control. Many people like the way it makes keyboard shortcuts easier to type.

I find it hard to remember keyboard shortucts too, so I use M-x a lot. M-x lets you call a command by its name. You can use C-h k to find out more about which function is called by a given keyboard shortcut, and then you can use M-x to call it by name if you don’t remember where it is. For example, if you don’t remember where split-window-vertically is bound, you can use M-x split-window-vertically.

Incidentally, M-x where-is will tell you the keyboard shortcuts if you know a function name, and C-h f (describe-function) will give you more information if you give it a function name.

Writing-wise, Org Mode (http://www.orgmode.org) is totally awesome. I use it to write some of my more structured blog posts and web pages, and I also use it to keep this gigantic outline of things I’m planning to write about: http://sach.ac/outline . People have used it to write technical books and other lengthy documents. It’s also a fantastic planner for running your daily life. =)

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I want
to help make Emacs easier to learn!

Oh, another tip: use M-x icomplete-mode to turn on incremental completion, which will then show you hints when you start typing M-x [command-name]. You can use TAB to complete as far as you can, and then type in a few more characters to disambiguate. To turn this on by default whenever you start Emacs, add the following to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el (you might need to create this file):

(icomplete-mode 1)

- Conventions
    - =C-...=
    - =M-...=
    - =SPC=
- Tutorial
    - =C-h t (help-with-tutorial)=
    - Learn basic commands
- Call commands by name
    - M-x
    - What if you don't remember what the command is called?
        - TAB
        - read the tutorial again
        - apropos-command
        - check out the manual
- Get help
    - =C-h f (describe-function)=
    - =C-h k (describe-key)=
    - =C-h m (describe-mode)=
    - =... C-h= at the end of a long keyboard shortcut
- Find out what the command's name is
  - apropos-command
    - more than one word: matches anything with at least two of the keywords
- Ergonomic tips
    - Caps as Control
    - ESC for Meta
    - holding down keys

2. Learn how to search and browse around.
3. Learn how to use Org to track TODO states. See http://orgmode.org/org.html#TODO-Items 
4. Use C-c [ to add Org files to your agenda list, and learn how to schedule tasks. See http://orgmode.org/org.html#Dates-and-Times and http://orgmode.org/org.html#Agenda-Views
5. Set up org-capture so that you can save notes to your Org file. http://orgmode.org/org.html#Capture-_002d-Refile-_002d-Archive
6. Learn how to archive, now that your Org file is getting pretty big. http://orgmode.org/org.html#Capture-_002d-Refile-_002d-Archive
7. Learn how to use tags and search. http://orgmode.org/org.html#Tags
8. Customize your Org agenda even further (org-agenda-custom-commands).

Requested by Michael Jones,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113FL6wzGbM&lcor=1&feature=em-comment_received&lc=KpT_4O34JGgJD_mmpkI68GQXwchUaxzf1QfTXJfEx4g&lch=email
http://www.youtube.com/user/Kembread

/Michael Jones wanted to know how I organized my Org Mode files. Here's how I do things!/

[[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode for Emacs]] is an outliner that lets you add a little structure
to plain text files. Not only can you use it to move around, hide, and
show sections of your outline, but you can also:
- schedule tasks and mark them as complete,
- add hyperlinks and formatting,
- estimate effort and track time,
- export to HTML and other formats,
- and even include code that you can run in-line.

I started with a single Org Mode file (appropriately called
organizer.org), but I've gradually fleshed this out into a number of
files. My goals for organizing my files this way are to be able to:

- Publish some files while keeping other files private,
- Add or remove groups of tasks from my agenda, or focus my
  agenda/search on the current file,
- Simplify processing my weekly review (categorizing
  accomplishments/tasks),
- Get a quick overview of important things, and
- Have file-specific options, like columns.

I often use [[http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs#agenda_commands][Org agenda custom commands]] to jump around. For example,
one agenda command lists projects, and pressing RET on an agenda line
will take me to that project. I also use =org-capture= to take a note
from anywhere, and I use =org-goto= to navigate my files. For finding
specific files, I use =ido-find-file=. 

I use several Org Mode files. The five files below have a little more
than 1.3MB of text in total - tiny! - but they help me tremendously. I
also have lots of other Org files like my [[http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs][Emacs configuration]] and [[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3968124/blog.html][my
blog index]] (I often use Org for publishing), but these are my main
files.

*Personal tasks and notes: organizer.org*

This is the catch-all for any tasks or notes that don't belong to the
files below. Here's the rough structure:

- *Quick notes:* Tidbits that might not make it into their own blog
  posts, but which can be included in weekly reviews
- *Reference:* Hours, license keys, etc.
- *Open loops:* Anything I need to check on every so often
- *Projects:* High-level things I'm focusing on
- *Financial goals:* Things to save up for
- *Someday/maybe:* Projects to do someday
- *Weekly review:* Divided by year
- *Monthly review:* More summaries
- *Plans:* Personal plans
- *2011, 2012, 2013...*: I use org-capture to quickly jot down notes.
  The datetree option automatically files them by day, which makes
  older ones easier to archive.
- *Tasks:* A bucket for miscellaneous tasks

*Anything to do with business: business.org*

I organize these by the types of tasks I focus on and the notes I
want to keep.

- Earn
  - Clients
  - Leads
- Build
  - Projects
  - Research
  - Business ideas
  - Blog
  - Delegation
  - Planning
  - Business hygiene (accounting, etc.)
  - Learning
- Connect
  - Meetups
  - Hangouts
  - Other
- Reference
- Tasks

*people.org*

I organize these by relationships so that I can remember who's out
there.

- Family
- Extended family
- Canada friends
- Hacklab
- Barkada
- Letters
- Meetups
- Bloggers
- Family friends
- Other tasks

*routines.org*

I organize these by frequency and omit the tasks from my weekly
review. This also contains my "In case of..." scenarios and my backup
documentation.

- Every day
- Once a week
- Once a month
- Once a quarter
- Once a year
- When...

*[[http://sach.ac/outline][sharing/index.org]]*

I organize this by topic. See http://sach.ac/outline for the
published version!

*decisions.org*

I organize these by status. I also use org-choose markers (ex:
CHOSEN, MAYBE) inside the categories, but the headings make it easier
to review.

- Pending
- Current
- For review
- Someday / maybe
- Archive

*How do you organize your Org files?*

Everyone's got different ways of organizing outlines, and people also
also change over time. How do you organize yours?

I would love to be able to write all of my blog posts within Emacs. I like the outline tools and simple markup of [[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]]. Org Mode and org2blog are invaluable when I'm writing a post with lots of code or keyboard commands, because it's easy to set up syntax highlighting or add teletype text. [[http://www.pablumfication.co.uk/2012/01/15/blog-posting-with-emacs-using-org2blog/][Here's an interesting self-referential example of org2blog's power]] - using =#INCLUDE= to include the Org blog post source in the post itself.

If I expect that a post will have lots of images, I tend to use Windows Live Writer because it takes care of resizing and aligning images, linking to the original size. Because it uses my blog's stylesheet, I can get a sense of how the text will flow around it. I can quickly draw an idea in Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, copy and paste it into Windows Live Writer, and then resize it until it feels balanced on the page. Sometimes I draft a post in Emacs and then open it in Windows Live Writer or ScribeFire so that I can add images. 

Org Mode also supports images, but it's not as easy to resize things there. If I wrote a function that used ImageMagick to save the clipboard image to a file, resize it to the appropriate dimensions, and link it to the full-size image, maybe that would do the trick. Still, that sounds like it would be a fair bit of work. Maybe someday. Hmm - any chance someone reading this blog happens to already have that snippet handy? =)

[[http://sach.ac/outline#blogging-skills]]

Here's my evolving break-down of blogging-related skills, including
notes for future blog posts. I'm currently working on getting better
at *outlining* (from high-level down to chunks of ~100 words)
and *synthesizing* (especially combining other people's insights with
my experiences). I'm using this outline to think of ways to
deliberately practise certain aspects of blogging, to plan posts that
will help people learn, and to clarify what I would like to delegate
to assistants or work with coaches for.

** OUTLINED How to blog, five minutes at a time: Making the most of little chunks of time :writing:

see the possibilities

prepare

- Brainstorm ideas and questions: Keep a text file and add to it whenever something inspires you.
- Brainstorm titles: Come up with three or more possible titles. Note: this is a separate step from brainstorming ideas, so you don't have to come up with an idea and an awesome title right from the start
- Make a rough outline: Outline topics (one line per post idea) or outline posts (one line per paragraph) to speed up writing.
- Research your topic and clip the pages: See what else is out there. Don't forget to bookmark or save the pages so that you can refer to it easily. Better yet, add links to your outline right away.
- Write a few sentences: 
- Proofread
- Edit
- Look for an image 

** Stuff that works for me

- Writing works better than interviews or speaking
    - Outlines, links
    - Even though I say a lot more words in an interview
    - Things I like about interviews
        - Other people's questions
        - Back and forth
        -

   :Effort:   4:00
   :END:
    - What happens if I spend four or more hours on a blog post? :TODO:
    - New superpower - I can take more time to do things than I used to.
        - Cooking. Reading.
        - And it pays off.
    - Also why: too much
    - Spending /more/ time on each blog post
        - Why? It's not just a blog post, it's the learning
        - No time pressures anyway
            - I've written far enough ahead that I'm not worried about running out of posts any time soon
            - I'm surrounded by ideas
        - I don't want to write a massive, useful, linkbait post that disappears from my brain after I write it. Like cramming for a school exam and then moving on.
    - What can I improve?
        - Filter through lots more material
        - Link to more resources; compare
        - Touch a post more often
            - Spread it out over several days
                - http://www.copyblogger.com/weekly-content-plan/
            - Let your subconscious work on it
            - Look at it with fresh(er) eyes
        - Write longer posts?
            - 900~2,000 words works well; doesn't feel too long
            - Write longer, then cut/restructure/spread out over time?
            - Go to 3,000 words? http://blog.osmosio.com/writing-a-blog-post/  
        - Wordsmith
        - Add more data
        - Add more images
        - Plan and conduct a mini-experiment, or apply the ideas to real life (deeper!)

        - http://www.problogger.net/archives/2013/06/25/what-would-happen-if-we-put-as-much-effort-into-writing-blog-posts-as-public-speaking/
            - Comments - balance with attention span
        - Trim text or split ideas off into other posts
    - What would success look and feel like?
        - I'm going to be selfish about this because I can. =)
            - Is it okay to say that I blog more for myself? Because I do. Although your comments, shares, and links are nice. I feel like I should say that I write for readers. Attention is a gift. Many people would say that attention is valuable, and then turn around and try to sell you something.
            - Someday, perhaps, when I have something I want to tell people, and I acquire a Voice of Advice, then I'll write more for other people.
                - When would I feel good about that?
                - Is there something I feel good about?
                    - I feel comfortable giving people advice on learning, reading, making better decisions, trying things out, and sharing.
                    - I feel comfortable helping people learn more about Emacs, Wordpress, and a little Excel.
                    - I feel comfortable that drawing is another way to create value.
            - In the meantime
                - If I want to invest more time in writing...
                    - I would write about things that few people write about
                        - Emacs? Visual thinking? What it's like to make blogging such a part of your learning?
                    - Drawing, right... Although Sketchnote Army does pretty well.
                    - Something else.
                - False dilemma. (Trilemma?) I know. The choice isn't really between these options, and I don't have to make one choice. I can write about all these things in the course of a week. But I wanted to figure out, if I wasn't keen on the first two options, what /am/ I leaning towards, so I can intentionally work on it?
            - A post that makes me a better person
                - Change
                - The posts I write make me at least a teensy bit better
                - In terms of outcome
                    - Blog posts that represent larger chunks of growing (going from 0.01% to 0.1%)?
                      Improving by 0.01% every day means getting 4% better in a year, if you're fine with simplified math. Improving by 0.1% every day means getting 44% better in a year.
                    - One way to do this is to write less, to sit on posts longer until they develop, to start with a hundred ideas and tweak them for days or weeks (or longer!) until they're deep and insightful and useful.
                        - Write less? No, I like writing almost every day, and I forget if I don't write things down. --verbose Stuff gets lost in my private notes. Here we might have conversations.
                            - Arguing against myself: reasons for posting earlier rather than later
                                - Learn from the conversation
                                - Get feedback
                                    - Is it something unusual worth digging into?
                                - Flesh things out on demand (in response to people's questions, etc.)
                                - Get good value from time (diminishing returns?) - 80%
                                - Throw more pots
                                    - Deliberate practice, engagement
                    - Another way to get a feel for what these deeper posts would be like would be to summarize experiences and update them with lessons learned
                        - For example, things I've learned in the past ten years, like cooking.
                        - This will give me a feel for what deeper posts might feel like.
                        - Then I can play with timeframes
                    - It would be worth getting the hang of this for new ideas, though.
                    - So I need to get better at getting better.
                    - Well, maybe an order of magnitude is ambitious. (0.01% to 0.1% is 10 times!) What would "a little better" look like?
                    - Grow more
                        - Ask better questions
                            - Know what "better" looks like and what direction it's in
                            - Ask the questions behind the questions
                            - Ask /different/ questions

                            - Describe
                            - Be less worried
                        - Try things out
                    - All that considered, I still want to write in small increments
                        - Behind the scenes
                            - It's like the way I take sketchnotes. I try to capture as much as I can instead of summarizing it, because you can summarize based on your notes but it's hard to go the other way around.
                        - I love being able to link to posts from years ago when I was still figuring something out
                        - There are plenty of people who'll share advice -- the results of their experiences -- without sharing (or remembering!) much of the journey along the way.
                    - So what's next for me then?
                        - Getting better at getting better
                        - Letting outlines steep
                            - I think I like leaving outlines hanging - it gives me something to focus on while doing the dishes or other chores






            - Something I want to remember
            - ... but not too much pressure here, mind you, or I'll probably be unable to write /anything/. So it doesn't have to Measurably Improve the Human Condition.
    - Now that I've confessed my primary motivation for writing a blog, I should also say that I get warm and fuzzies when people find my notes useful.
    - Adjusting the slider; nudge it up a little, play with it
    - Now
        - Half an hour to an hour, effective rate 30wpm
        - Some posts come out of technical learning or troubleshooting, so the time doesn't count the time I spent solving the problem.
        - Other posts, I start from scratch, do some research, think about stuff, dig deeper. 
        - Outline helps a lot with that.
            - It was hard to do this before outlining because I couldn't see and manage my drafts as well.
        - Easy for me to track, especially if I'm writing it in Emacs.
            - I can track how much time I spend outlining a specific post and which days I worked on it.
            - I can set a target effort (ex: at least two hours4 hours) and compare the total time against that.

    - Four hours is around the time I usually take to plan a presentation
        - Who
        - What do I want people to remember or act on
        - What do I need to share to help them get from A to B
        - Illustrations
    
    - Oh, maybe that will be my reason to split off sub-blogs
        - If I wrote like other people
            - I would include less "I" and more "You", giving people advice
            - I would emphasize the categories more
            - More lists and stats?
            - 1% better.

** OUTLINED [#C] Balancing "useful" and "personal" on my blog
Lower-priority: I can wait until it seems more likely that my balance will change, or I can transform this into a post about blog role models and getting closer 

- Good balance
- What kind of balance do I want to have?
- I'm thinking about this because this balance might change
- As an introvert, I don't want to impose on other people
  - I'm somewhat okay with blog reading being completely voluntary
  - This is why I haven't gotten around to e-mail newsletters yet, even though reading is voluntary too.
  - Maybe I don't have to? 
- I want most of my posts to be *useful.*
- I don't want to be generic. What's the point of writing something you could just find on Lifehacker? So I tell stories about what I'm learning.
- What I want to avoid:
  - Article mills
  - Me-me-me-blah-blah-blah
- But there are good examples
  - Lifehacker tends to be impersonal
  - The Simple Dollar is a little closer to the impersonal side of things, but is sprinkled with personal stories
  - Penelope Trunk and Mel Chua write more personally than I do
    - What makes their blogs feel more personal?
      - Penelope Trunk writes about more stresses and difficulties. 
    - Mel's writing communicates her excitement and passion
  - Mr. Money Mustache is a great mix of useful + personal.
    - I think, of all the blogs I read, I like his the most.
** OUTLINED Blog models: Learning from Mr. Money Mustache
- Why I like Mr. Money Mustache's blog
  - Excellent balance of useful and personal
  - topic is interesting as well, of course
  - frugality - not just pinching pennies or juggling finances, but living well 
- What are some of the things that Mr. Money Mustache does differently?
  - Writing
    - The alias is nifty and amusing. 
    - He's more frank about finance (naturally).
    - He's great at poking fun at himself. [[http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/07/10/if-i-woke-up-broke/][more]] 
    - He uses stronger language, including more intense adjectives and some swearing. He also uses a wider vocabulary and more wordplay. [[http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/04/29/frequently-complained-questions/][more]] I should totally give myself permission to use less common words. =)
    - He uses more stats, calculations, and case studies. [[http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/06/13/bicycling-the-safest-form-of-transportation/][more]]
    - He's more confident about giving advice. 
  - Formatting
    - He doesn't always emphasize the key points in his paragraphs, but they're readable anyway.
    - His posts tend to be longer.
    - He uses shorter paragraphs.
    - His tables are formatted more prettily. Hey, sometimes it's the small stuff... =)
  - Organization
    - He's focused on financial blogging and the frugal lifestyle, while I blog about whatever I'm interested in.
  - He gets a lot of input from readers
    - People share their situations and give each other advice
  - Layout
    - His front page uses a summary layout with larger visuals.
    - He has large graphical ads in the sidebar.
    - He uses a serif font and a visually divided background
    - His links are underlined in the post body, although not elsewhere.
    - Links open in a new window. (Hmm, I've got mixed feelings about that...)
    - He has a large post footer which has a blog, a new reader welcome, a random link, subscription/social media instructions, a community forum, and a subscription form, previous/next links with titles, and /then/ comments, trackbacks, and the comment form.
    - He has a large page footer with a blog roll, popular posts, stats, selected categories, and tags.
    - He has a "Start Here" and a menu item for various how-tos.
    - He has a recommendations page with links to posts.
** How to turn your e-mail newsletters into blog posts
Why: because there are people who send e-mail, but don't blog

- why don't they blog?
  - self-conscious: only the "best content" out there
** Blogging excuse-buster: I don't want to blog because I want to put my best foot forward

This is something I hear a lot from people. "I don't want to blog
because I might be embarrassed." 

** Blogging excuse-buster: 
** Update: What I want my blog to become

- I took a month off from my two-days-a-week consulting gig so that I
  could experiment with focusing on writing. 
- I want to be all-the-way-retired. There's a chance I might be. I'm
  not sure. 
- Most writers don't even have this luxury: to write about whatever
  they want to write, without worrying about whether the book will be
  picked up by a publisher or whether the magazine will accept the
  article.


- The M word: Monetization
    - I thought about what I would use more money to do
      http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/on-blogging-and-platforms-and-experimenting-with-google-hangout/
        - I wouldn't change my lifestyle all that much 
        - More money would probably be split between
            - more experiments
            - and buying more time to spend with family and friends
    - Probably won't need to put a lot of effort into marketing and
      building an audience
        - Reasons to go out there
            - Can save other people time?
            - Can learn from other people?
            - 
- So this is what's going to happen for as long as I can do it.
    - I'm going to learn lots of things.
        - Curious
        - What people ask me about
        - From time to time, I may even dust off my outlines for future
          books
        - but I'd rather publish things bit by bit
        - Eventually I'll get good enough at writing from outlines (or
          slotting things back into them) that I can put together larger
          resources, like articles and books

** Thoughts on growing an audience
- Sometimes I wonder if I should do more of the "Right Things" when
  it comes to building a blog.
    - Focus on one or two topics so that people will subscribe because
      you're consistent and reliable.
    - Research keywords so that you can optimize for search engines
      queries and write content that will bring people in.
    - Reach out to new audiences with guest posts.
    - Send e-mail newsletters so that you can build relationships and
      so that you can sell to people later on.
- Why
    - Can save other people time
    - Can learn from more people
    - Scale up - create more value for each unit of time I invest
- Sometimes I'm envious of blogs with hundreds of comments. On sites
  like that, people learn a lot from each other, not just me. But I
  remember that reading and responding to comments takes time, and I'd
  want to filter through them for spam, and that other people glaze
  over when they see pages and pages of comments and end up not
  reading them. It's okay. I like the in-depth conversations we have
  in comments. I'm not entirely sure if I'm sour-graping, but it seems
  to make sense.
- Sometimes I wonder if this should be more like other blogs. But then
  that's a well-travelled path, with lots of other people exploring
  it. I have this amazing opportunity to try something different. I
  should.
- Actually, I already know what I should do--what works for me, what
  I should do more.
    - The enduring posts on my blog are either tech notes (Emacs,
      Drupal) or sketches.
- The clearer my "no", the less I'm distracted from the things that I
  can do.
- Like the way I hack around my introversion
    - Write about whatever I'm learning about - variety of interests, and
      let more focused people use search results and category links
    - Look at other people's questions and failed search results to
      nudge me to write about certain topics if I'm curious about them
      too
    - Read good blogs and write about what inspires me, linking.
      Invite people who don't have blogs to share their tips and
      lessons learned on mine.
    - Build relationships through comments. Give away as much as I
      can of what I know. Let people show their appreciation if they
      want to. Money is nice, but there are other ways too.
- Risks in getting too big
    - Internet has a seamy underside
- Introvert
- The time I would spend in pitching guest posts, etc.
    - versus making things

- Drawing
    - Nearly 39,000 people visited in May, when I published
    - Plenty of blogs
    - Lots of infographics
    - Not that many useful, non-marketing drawings
- It's okay

- Are there low-effort, high-benefit things I can do to make this better?

    - Might get to the point where people are learning from each other
        - You can do this elsewhere on the Internet
        - So it would have to be a particularly interesting
          combination of people

** Blogs and e-mail newsletters

- conversation with Timothy Kenny, who has just started experimenting with daily e-mail newsletters
- I suggested public archive

- http://www.productiveflourishing.com/why-i-was-so-worked-up-about-killing-my-newsletter/#utm_source=feedly

- I've been thinking about e-mail newsletters because Timothy Kenny
  has just started with his.
- Typical advice for growing and (dare I say it?) monetizing your
  blog.
  - Offer an incentive for people to sign up for your mailing list.
    - PDF
    - exclusive content
  - Put people on an autoresponder.
  - Mail people regularly to build the relationship
    - Sell them stuff later on
- I don't even send friends or family e-mail normally
  - Hmm, maybe I'm not used to the grammar of it?
- also, it takes me an average of 6 minutes to reply to an e-mail. 
  - Oddly,
- RSS is mostly dead. Only geeky people use it. [[blog-subscribe][outline]]
- Automatic e-mail newsletters
- I want to sell things only if they save you a lot of time
- Forget that. I want to give away so much that you almost feel
  obliged to help.
  - and since I don't need that much money for my lifestyle (I think)
- I'm very good at planning inexpensive experiments. Besides, that
  makes it easier for other people to replicate.

** Why and how to subscribe to blogs
# <<blog-subscribe>> 

- since not everyone knows about this
- why
  - i read a lot of blogs
  - i *skim* a lot of blog headlines and excerpts, and I read maybe
    3-5 posts a day
  - i mostly read on my phone
- how
  - my favourite: feedly
  - there are a number of alternatives, so it mostly depends on what
    you like

Objective: Be more effective at outlining my blog posts; Help other

about

- Breaking skills down into their components (Tim Ferris)
- Why outlining?
  - Pseudocode and prototypes
  - Some moments of discipline to keep fleshing things out
  - More about the freedom to make slow and steady progress, knowing
    that a plan keeps me roughly on track
  - Freedom to cut and rearrange
- What I'm doing
  - Tracking outlining time separately; butt-in-chair time
  - Sharing my outline
  - Tracking versions
- Tools
  - Org Mode workflow
    - Outline
    - Lists
    - Navigation
      - C-c j (org-goto) to jump around
    - Filtering
      - C-c v (org-show-todo-tree) shows the ones that have been
        marked with a status (good to see which ones I've outlined)
      - Tags
    - Refiling?
    - Publishing and archiving
  - Github
- Imagining wild success
  - Outline of things I want to share
  - The feel for how things flow together
  - People can easily review the outline - maybe with org-info?
  - People can tell me what they're interested in - maybe with a way
      for me to note who I should follow up with, but in a way that
      doesn't require me to keep a private repository? Maybe tied in
      with e-mail...

** DONE Thinking about stock photos
   CLOSED: [2013-08-11 Sun 18:06]
- Featured image
  - Blog readers
  - Magazine theme
  - Visually break up a page
- Many blogs use photos to make the posts more visually interesting
- Lifehacker does this well
- Inhibitors
  - I don't like the way stock photos of people feel staged. I don't
    identify with the people.
  - Stock photos without people feel a little cold.


The advice these days is to include a large image in your blog post,
somewhere “above the fold”, so that it can attract attention, visually
break up the page, and make your blog post more interesting.

I’m still trying to get the hang of how this might work. Other blogs
do this pretty well – Lifehacker, for example. More often, though,
stock photos look fake. Too posed. Too perfect. I could never quite
get the hang of


Hypothesis:
- I can get better at visually communicating if I learn how to use
  stock photos effectively.
- What does it mean to effectively use stock photos?

** DONE Thinking about how I can use Evernote more effectively
   CLOSED: [2013-08-11 Sun 18:06]

It took me a couple of hours, but I finally cleared the 700+ items
that had piled up in my Evernote inbox. Every so often, I go on a
tagging and filing spree. I was thinking about this because Timothy
Kenny told me how he has a virtual assistant file the notes in his
Microsoft OneNote notebooks.

Is my filing really worth it? Is it something I value enough to pay
someone else to do? Could I explain what I wanted clearly enough so
that other people could do it? Could I benefit from organization even
if I'm not the one organizing things myself?

Before I dig into that, I should probably examine this question: *What
do I use Evernote for, and what could "better" look like?*

Here's a quick summary of the different reasons I use Evernote:

  |                                | <20>                 |                                                         |                                                                               |

  | Blog research?                 | Clipped pages so they'll show up in Google Search and related notes, and so that I can review them even if the source disappears (payoff > 2 years) | No organization; search by keywords or sourceurl:       | Clip, but remove from inbox quickly                                           |

I have different types of clipping activities:
- *A. Researching a topic*, which results in lots of clips related to a
  single topic. Usually in preparation for a blog post or as a way to
  answer a question.
- *B. Casual browsing and clipping* based on blog posts, news items, or
  other things I come across; roughly topical (ex: skill
  development), although may be tagged and filed in different places
- *C. Saving reference material from email or websites*, which should be filed
- *D. Adding notes on the go using my phone*, which should be reviewed
  and acted on or filed when I get back to my computer
- *E. Automatically clipping things based on external input*, using
  services like IFTTT to archive my blog posts.

There are several strategies I could use to manage my Evernote
collection. I can choose different strategies based on the results
that I want. Here are some possibilities:

- *A. Spend a few extra seconds tagging and filing things when I clip
  them.* Advantage: I touch something once, so I don't have to recall
  the context of an item.
- *B. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file shortly after
  clipping.* Advantages: I can select multiple entries and tag them
  give them the same tags, and copy all the note links in one go.
- *C. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file weekly.* This is my
  current strategy. This isn't working out too well - things pile up.
- *D. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then teach someone to file.*

I think strategy B will give me a good improvement in performance
without me needing to bring in someone else.

One of the areas that I could generally improve in is integrating the
notes into my outlines and plans. Instead of just collecting the
information, maybe I can use Copy Note Link and then spend some time
adding those links to my outline. Alternatively, I can copy the
source URL right then and there, find where it fits into my outline,
and paste the link. If org2blog respects comments, I could even use
that as part of my workflow.

So if I were to outsource more tasks in order to improve my
effectiveness at learning, I think I'd gain more value from finding
someone who can speed-read like I do, filtering through lots of cruft
on the Internet to find high-quality resources. They could then clip
those pages into Evernote for my review. That might be worth an
experiment or two... Let's find out how that works!

Does org2blog respect comments? If so, I can use that to add more details.

I miss teaching. I had tons of fun teaching computer science when I
was in the Philippines, coming up with different analogies and
exercises. 

Stephanie Diamond suggested making a sketchnotes course on Udemy.
People have asked me about teaching Emacs, or blogging, or Quantified
Self tracking and analysis.

- What would you want to learn for free?
- What would you value at $49?
- What would you value at $99?

Help me figure out a good curriculum that could help you!

** It's okay to be wrong
At an applied rationality meetup in Toronto, the guest speaker
confessed to being afraid of blogging because she didn't want to be
pinned down to words. 

People think of writing as final. The fuzziness of conversation in
memory might let you argue, "That's not what I said," but writing
leaves you no wiggle room. 

It's okay to be wrong.

The resistance is a symptom that you're on the right track. /The
resistance is not something to be avoided; it's something to seek
out./ ... The artist sees out the feeling of the resistance and then
tries to maximize it. The cog, the day laborer, the compliant
student--they seek to eliminate the feeling instead.

** How does tracking affect your happiness?
** [#C] Time-tracking workshop  :book-idea:PROJECT:
*** Session 1: The Whys and Hows of Tracking Time
Discuss objectives and motivations for tracking time. Plan possible questions you want to ask of the data (which influences which tools to try and how to collect data). Recommend a set of tools based on people’s interests and context (paper? iPhone? Android? Google Calendar?).
Resources: Presentations on time-tracking, recommendations for tools, more detail on structuring data (categories, fields); possible e-mail campaign for reminders
Output: Planning worksheet for participants to help people remember their motivations and structure their data collection; habit triggers for focused, small-scale data collection, buddying up for people who prefer social accountability
*** Session 2: Staying on the Wagon + Preliminary Analysis
Checking in to see if people are tracking time the way they want to. Online and/or one-on-one check-ins before the workshop date, plus a group session on identifying and dealing with obstacles (because it helps to know that other people struggle and overcome these things). Preliminary analysis of small-scale data.
Resources: Frequently-encountered challenges and how to deal with them; resources on habit design; tool alternatives
Output: Things to try in order to support habit change; larger-scale data collection for people who are doing well
*** Session 3: Analyzing your data
Massaging your data to fit a common format; simple analyses and interpretation
Resources: Common analysis format and some sample charts/instructions; maybe even a web service?
Output: Yay, charts!
*** Session 4: More ways you can slice and dice your data
Bring other questions you’d like to ask, and we’ll show you how to extract that out of your data (if possible – and if not, what else you’ll probably need to collect going forward). Also, understanding and using basic statistics
Resources: Basic statistics, uncommon charts
Output: More analyses!
*** Session 5: Making data part of the way you live
Building a personal dashboard, integrating your time data into your decisions
Outcome: Be able to make day-to-day decisions using your time data; become comfortable doing ad-hoc queries to find out more
*** Session 6: Designing your own experiments
Designing experiments and measuring interventions (A/B/A, how to do a blind study on yourself)
Outcome: A plan for changing one thing and measuring the impact on time
*** Session 7: Recap, Show & Tell
Participants probably have half a year of data and a personal experiment or two – hooray! Share thoughts and stories, inspire each other, and figure out what the next steps look like.
Outcome: Collection of presentations

use cases and you want to sum the points for all the use cases with
priority 1. =SUMIFS= (Microsoft Excel 2007 and later) is even more
powerful - it allows you to specify multiple criteria.

Imagine I have amazing assistants and a smoothly-running team. What am I doing with those capabilities?

2 days a week, I'm focused on talking to people. I'm booked efficiently; tea, lunch, tea, second tea. Some of these meetings involve walks instead of food. The meetings cluster in various locations in order to minimize travel time. I might have one day for face-to-face meetings and one day for virtual meetings.

After each meeting, I have at least half an hour to define next actions and get the ball rolling. It's easy to prioritize based on time and importance. We get the first actions out right away, impressing people, and then we follow up with depth. My assistant fills in the time with other tasks from the next actions list. I have at least 20 hours of work for people, so it's easy for them to focus.

Types of things I delegate:
Scheduling - I forward them emails and get back neatly formatted calendar entries
Email response handling - they read my mail, prioritize, send me action items, and work on tasks.
Web research - I send them questions and get back summaries of the top ten resources I should read. I suggest search queries, and they add their own.
Illustration - I have backup illustrators who can sketchnote things that I can't get to, or who can share different styles and metaphors.
Development - When I have an idea about Rails or Wordpress, I can work with someone to make it happen.
Web design - themes, tweaks, beautifully HTMLized pages...
Copywriting and copyediting - I send things over and get polished, engaging content
Calls - Assistants can take care of calling businesses when they're open and following up if needed, such as when setting appointments or making reservations.
Layout - I share a Dropbox folder with a bunch of graphics or documents. The assistant lays things out so that they're well-balanced in terms of whitespace and size.
Transcription - I save webinars and interviews (or set people up to record) into a Dropbox shared folder, and I send an email. I get a well-formatted blog post or document with the cleaned-up transcript.
Outlining and writing - someone helps me brainstorm blog post topics and outlines, fleshing them out with research, and organizing the topics into books
Video - editing, synchronizing sound, adding transitions, etc.
...

I also have recurring tasks for projects and initiatives I care about. Things just work smoothly. I get confirmations.

I have this lovely web-based process manual and a visual overview of tasks.

I'm always collecting people for my pipeline.
Hiring is not stressful - I have good onboarding and offboarding
processes. I hire shortly before I really need to, so that I can ramp
up people.

** OUTLINED How I (want to) use outsourcing to help me learn more effectively
# <<outsource-learning>>

Goal: Learn, share, scale
- Package lots of e-books on a pay-what-you-can basis, or whatever
  people would like (support/subscription?)


- Learning from people
  - [ ] Identify interesting people to learn from
    - Hmm... is there a way I can do this more efficiently? Scanning
      the first 50 Google Blog Search results gets me 5
      high-quality resources, which I could probably filter just
      based on the titles alone.
    - Huh. This could be harder than I thought, because I'm not that
      happy with the resources that are out there. Maybe I should
      figure out a better strategy.
    - What do I want in terms of learning from people?
      - Write blog posts with links to other people's interesting perspectives
      - Slowly collect interesting people to follow in my feed reader
      - Keep in mind the specialties of my blog readers and other
        people who don't blog on their own
    - Possible outsourcing approach
      - SPEC: Given a topic, give me an outline or spreadsheet
       highlighting bloggers who have written good blog posts about the
       topic
        - well-written (good English, few grammar or spelling mistakes,
          good paragraph separation, maybe uses bold/color/italics for
          emphasis)
        - includes personal experiences, not just generic advice or reblogging
        - includes action items or recommendations
        - includes links to other resources (and not just
          selling content or promoting a business)
        - discussed: has at least two comments, one of which should be
          a reply from the author (unless the post is less than a week old)
        - active: at least 1 post a month, and has posted recently
      - Rubric:
        - Excellent: 
          - Went through ~10 pages of Google search results and
            narrowed it down to 5-10 excellent items
          - Highlighted bloggers or websites who wrote repeatedly
            about a topic, browsing through categories or tags to find
            related posts
          - Added a short description of how the pages differ from
            each other
            differ from each other  
        - Good:
          - Went through ~5 pages of Google search results and narrowed it
            down to 5-10 good articles
          - Organized the list of articles to put excellent/insightful
            blogs at the top
        - Mediocre: 
          - Sends a list of URLs with no explanations

** What services should I be taking advantage of?
** DONE Getting some help with blogging

# <<blogging-help>>
http://sach.ac/outline#blogging-help

- I'm thinking of investing more in my blog, maybe experimenting with.
- NOT
  - having someone "spin" keyword-laden content for me
  - someone to keep me accountable re: writing - it's already a habit =)
- Why
  - I want to get better at writing
  - One way: Identify and deliberately practice [[blogging-skills][blogging skills]]
    - Current focus areas
      - Outlining (mostly comfortable; need to get to the point of calibrating outline to ~100 words?)
      - Synthesizing information (lists, etc.), bringing everything together with a conclusion or recommendations
    - Next steps
      1. Write better headlines 
      2. End strong: conclusion, call to action, question
      3. Start strong: improve first paragraph
      4. Pick better post topics (research, feedback, etc.)
      5. Get into the habit of sending newsletter e-mail, maybe for upcoming blog posts
      6. Get into the habit of updating, organizing, and packaging information resources
    - Doing this, having fun, making progress.
      - Hmm, might be interesting to think about how to measure this progress
  - Another way: coaching
    - Ideally, someone with better skills
      - Model excellence and call their shots
      - Give feedback on gaps
      - Help me teach others
      - Ideal scenario?
        - We pick a skill to focus on, like synthesizing information
        - They recommend some of their favourite role models
        - We come up with exercises or challenges (I'm currently listify-ing at least one post per week; ditto stock photos)
        - (We might be able to skip the research part for now, as that's time-consuming and lower-value than planning/editing.)
        - They help me improve the logical organization of the outline
        - They help me improve the transitions and organization of the draft post
        - We brainstorm better headlines and calls to action / questions for the audience
          - Also, related Twitter post?
    - Even a different perspective is useful
      - Check whether something makes sense
        - I don't care about typos if the meaning stays the same
        - I care about good headlines and saying clear, useful, time-saving, non-obvious things
        - I care about explaining things that people might find confusing
          - I might write a blog post for an advanced audience, but it would be good to flag what needs to be explained for intermediate audiences etc. and then fill that in with blog posts later on
            - How to map this out?  
        - I care about tightening things up and making transitions smooth
      - Need more precise feedback than "It doesn't work." I want to see alternatives.
      - Learning how to put my editing hat on
  - Brainstorming/planning stage?
    - Outline, notes, quotes, examples, questions
    - Follow-up blog posts
  - Also possibly useful: research and editing help
    - People will search using different keywords and sources than I might
    - Good for prioritizing lots of resources
      - Value depends
        - Do I read faster than they do? Can I filter through resources faster?
        - Do they have similar or better prioritization functions? Am I wowed by their choices?
        - Comparative advantage?  
      - Is the following the ideal scenario for that? This is some time in the future, though, after I get used to working with other people while writing.
        - I send the person an outline and some notes, and he or she
          sends back summaries of the best resources with citations
          and links. I add personal stories (this comes after research
          because I want to apply advice and it's better than just
          searching for confirmatory evidence) and publish.
    - Good for editing transcripts and misc. documents too, possibly handling some of the regular publishing (ex: sketchnotes or updates)?
  - Process tips? 
    - Tools and processes are harder to transfer
    - Metacognition?  
- Good to have a safety net: at some point, I anticipate being more frazzled. This is part of life.
  - I could do what other people do and _not_ blog, but it's more fun to learn from the conversation.
  - Good to have someone doublecheck that I'm making sense
  - Make sure that I'm writing useful stuff instead of focusing too much on my life
    - Yes, it's a personal blog, but I may as well be useful at the same time =)
    - And also check that I'm not /too/ impersonal, because that would be boring
  - Do some of that research, maybe?
  - Investment in ongoing learning and connection
    - May need to prioritize
    - or may just need to learn how to put my editing hat on
- Justifying value
  - Competing options
    - Options
      - Do it myself
        - I'm doing pretty well
        - Lots of great tips out there
        - I'm nowhere near the limit of what I can learn for free or from experience
        - Use books and role models for passive guidance
      - Learn from people's feedback
        - This is great! People comment and share
      - Find or start a blogging mastermind group
        - Group insight, more perspectives
        - Group plans, support; building relationships
          - Casual examples: Mel Chua, Trevor Lohrbeer, Timothy Kenny - no formal connections between them, but good conversations
      - Advantages of coach/assistant
        - Opportunity for targeted, skilled, consistent feedback 
        - Learn more about delegation and coaching
  - Justifying investment
    - Worth an experiment
      - How long? Extent?
        - As-needed basis
        - Risk: I might forget to assign work
          - I should prepare and assign work up front
        - Once a week, at least a month?
          - What does this look like?
            - Google Docs or Draft, e-mail notifications
              - ... because I'm unlikely to find someone who can commit straight to Github ;)
            - Google Hangout chat for clarification/discussion if needed
            - Probably 2-3 hours a week, picking one post to focus on
              - make it awesome and link-worthy!
                - although the easiest way to do that is to go and sketchnote something (book review, talk, resource, etc.)
                - goal is to learn how to do this with just writing, or with a combination of writing and /some/ graphics  
      - How does this compare with previous experiment with editing?
        - http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/11/thinking-about-how-i-can-make-the-most-of-editing-the-world-is-an-amazing-candy-store-of-talent/
        - Not as focused on wordsmithing 
          - http://sachachua.com/blog/2009/12/editing-feedback-on-the-shy-connector/
        - How am I better at writing now?
          - Outlines, illustrations
      - What would be worth it?
        - At the end of the experiment
          - Good: I'm more comfortable synthesizing key points from research and stitching them together in a smooth, non-plagiaristic way that adds value
          - Awesome: I wrap up the post with a good conclusion, a call to action, and a question
          - Amazing: I have a better sense of headlines, and a plan for testing/improving
            - Okay with needing different coaches - work with people's strengths

    - How to continue justifying the experiment
      - Canada Revenue Agency: must be business-related expense with expectation of income
      - Deeper feedback versus superficial feedback, explaining what's going on 
        - Ex: reorganizing the logic of a piece and explaining why, instead of making tiny word changes (remove "just", etc. - useful, but not as useful as the other kind of feedback)
      - Sell information products or courses, maybe on a pay-what-you-can basis 
      - Use as a regular weekly sanity-check for batch processing
        - Grant access to Wordpress?
        - Work out a different workflow, maybe Evernote? (Evernote doesn't paste well)
- Acknowledgements
  - Happy to share before/after views and a link in posts
  - and naturally, lots of process reflections and updates!

# <<advance-criteria>>

http://sach.ac/outline#advance-criteria

Examples: 
- Trevor's story about finding a house 
- Planning a menu (patterns)
- Choosing a computer

Outline:
- The difference between maximizing and satisficing [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing][more]]
- Why
  - Make decisions quickly
    - Discard choices that are obviously worse
    - Jump on opportunities
  - Make decisions more reasonably 
    - Esp. if you anticipate poor decision capability
      - "Your ability to think rationally may be impaired. It is
        therefore suggested that you avoid making any important
        decisions until the effects of the medications have fully worn
        off." - from pre-procedural sedation instructions
    - Don't forget important criteria; value of a checklist
  - Make decisions consistently over time
    - Ex: hiring decisions
  - Get other people to help you look
- How
  - Decide on your criteria in advance
  - Prioritize
    - You probably won't be able to get everything
    - What's good enough?
    - Weighted scoring helps

** Something I want to get better at: Planning my way through uncertainty

- I don't know what next month will be like, or the months beyond
  that.
  - cloud of possibilities
- Scary
  - Why
    - Uncomfortable making and possibly renegotiating commitments
    - In limbo about some plans
- Uncertainty is good
  - Learning how to deal with it
  - Learning
- Good outcome
  - Not blindsided by unknown risks; have a flexible contingency plan 
  - Comfortable with decisions even if they turn out badly
  - Documented decisions so that I can review and improve my
    decision-making process
  - Fire drill so that I have something in place
- How I deal with uncertainty
  - Minimize commitments
    - Unexpected perks of semi-retirement: I can be open about
      uncertainty

  - Scenario planning
    - Research
      - What's out there?
      - Which outcomes are more likely? less likely?
    - Plan for the negative scenarios
    - Plan for possibilities
- Lessons from other places
  - Lean
    - No forecasts, less waste

 
...deliberate attempt to separate what we do and do not know about the
future, and to use that as a basis for exploring many possible futures
... "A better approach now is to embrace uncertainty and examine it in
detail to discover where the hidden opportunities lurk."
- Paul J. H. Schoemaker (, in http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2298
- Kristel van der Elst (World Economic Forum)
  - Identify central question
  - Identify driving forces and systemic changes that will transform
    the playing field (social, technological, economic,
    environmental, (geo)political)
  - Look at things that could happen, not just extensions of the
    present
  - Determine critical uncertainties (impact vs certainty)
  - Back into decision-making process - strategy that creates value
    in several scenarios, backup plan

The point of scenario planning, after all, is not to be right, which
is such a human inclination that we find it hard to overcome—the point
of scenario planning is to see the future from perspectives we would
have a difficult time forcing ourselves to imagine because of our bias
toward rightness, and therefore imagine new possibilities or see
threats we might otherwise miss.
The trick is to know we will always be wrong as we speculate about the
future

Yet, the purpose of scenario planning is not to pinpoint future events
but to highlight large-scale forces that push the future in different
directions. It's about making these forces visible, so that if they do
happen, the planner will at least recognize them. It's about helping
make better decisions today.

** What makes a good decision

** Process, not outcome
- What makes a decision a good decision?
- Good decision or bad decision - process, not outcome

- Good process [[http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_79.htm][more]], [[http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_00.htm#Step1][more]]
  - Understand likely possibilities
  - Reasonably estimate cost/benefit/risk/reward
  - Make a decision you're willing to commit to (versus passing the
    buck)
  - Base decision on accurate information (and keeping sources in
    mind - credibility, bias)
  - Aware of the situation
  - Have contingency plans
  - Address the real issue
  - Not flipflopping on the decision (reduce uncertainty)
  - Aware of assumptions, have tested some of them
  - Have considered a number of solutions
  - Can explain decision
  - I use effective decision tools
  - [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemyatt/2012/03/28/6-tips-for-making-better-decisions/][more]]
  - [[http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_79.htm][more]]
    - Establishing a positive decision-making environment.
    - Generating potential solutions.
    - Evaluating the solutions.
    - Deciding.
    - Checking the decision.
    - Communicating and implementing.
- See more at: http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_79.htm#sthash.cuOU5nXf.dpuf
- Process != outcome
  - Good process, good outcome - invisible, but celebrate it
    - ex: experiment (so far)
  - Good process, bad outcome - is it still the decision you would
    make knowing what you knew then? What did you fail to consider?
    - ex: buying the Cintiq? unexpected outcome
  - Bad process, good outcome - luck, chance of superstition
    - choosing Ateneo
  - Bad process, bad outcome - double regret
    - lost passport
- But if you’re consistently getting bad outcomes, maybe you need to
  rethink your process

** Starting my own business
* Personal finance
** Discretionary expenses
** Investing in making the pie bigger
(rough thoughts)
My default approach is to save
Where am I not investing
** Saving versus spending
** OUTLINED Reinvesting in business and in life
- Motivating conflict
  - My conflict: default is saving, lots of uncertainty, want security
  - also, technical skills/general interests; see the value in developing the skills myself, so tempted to do everything
  - BUT if I invest, I can learn more, and I can be better-prepared for opportunities + shifts in time/energy/capabilities
  - The trick is to focus on enduring benefits and constant improvement
- Imagining wild success
  - Set aside enough to calm my lizard brain and feel reasonably safe (FireCalc.com)
  - Earmarked funds for things that are important to me (ex: opportunity fund, flights home, helping out around the house)
  - Good sense for value
  - Structured review process
- Understanding my goals and how I can invest in them
  - Business
    - Consulting: Help people connect and collaborate better at work through internal social networking
    - Sketchnoting: Help more people see sketchnoting as a great way to take and share notes
      - Help it become a well-known option for events, and make it easier for organizers to connect with sketchnote artists
      - Help people get started with sketchnoting on their own
    - Life
      - Quantified: Make better decisions through data, and build tools to simplify data collection and analysis
      - Knowledge-sharing: Share what I'm learning - blog posts, drawings, screencasts, e-books, courses, and so on

** What would you do with more money?  :link:
One of the downsides of building a really good frugality muscle (that reflexive reaction of "Oh, I don't really need this, do I?") is that

I’ve been reading through Mr. Money Mustache’s blog archive, and his blog post on What would you do with WAY MORE money? made me think about what I value and what I would change. Like him, I’m comfortable with the way things are. I like eating at home. I like getting books and movies from the library instead of buying them. (No storage or waste issues, wide selection, and the satisfaction of boosting library circulation statistics…) I like my hobbies and interests. I like my freedom from the endless hedonic treadmill.
Not even the latest apps or gadgets, aside from the occasional experiment. (Shh! I hope they don’t take away my geek card. ;) )
About the only thing that would be awesomer would be to make more frequent trips to the Philippines (maybe every year! or on a whim!) or to join family and friends on their vacations. Although that’s constrained by other things too, like the fact that I like spending time with W- and he needs to be here in Toronto for J-.

** Living an off-peak life  :link:

It’s finally spring in full force, and I’ve been biking whenever I can get away with it. The bike ride is a little faster than the subway commute to my client, and I like not have to squeeze into the crowded train. Free exercise along a well-maintained trail with plenty of flowers and trees…

** Substituting pleasures
It’s been easier and easier to substitute pleasures. A $12 bowl of pho is yummy, but a $2 banh mi sandwich will do just fine. Why buy a DVD (even a used one) if there are so many unwatched ones at the library? I have clothes I haven’t worn in ages.
** Managing my personal and business finances
** Time and gadget tradeoffs
** What's worth spending on?
I'd been contemplating this question for the past four years.

What's worth spending on? I invest for the future, save for unexpected expenses, and support causes and people - but it's good to have that discretionary part of my budget which I can use to enjoy life and learn how to make better decisions.

Many people care about stuff. I apporeciate that. There are many examples of things that have enabled me to enjoy and learn from life so much more, such as my tablet PC.

Many people care about experiences. I appreciate that, too. I like how experiences can lead to deeper relationships.

Many people know something else that I'm just beginning to figure out. You can spend on people, on time, on making things happen. This is awesome! There's a candy store of talent out there - a world full of people with unique experiences, skills, and passions.

Like the way I've learned about what works well for me in terms of
spending on stuff and experiences, I want to learn how to spend on
making things happen. And who knows? If I can get good enough at it,
maybe I can learn how to create so much value that it becomes a
self-perpetuating machine.

** It's about time

(personal motivation)
More than anything, I wanted time. Ever since I was a kid, I had
always been acutely aware of how short a time we actually have. (Can I
blame this on reading about Raistlin's hourglass eyes in Dragonlance,
which I suppose was my first introduction to Stoic negative
visualization?) Being halfway around the world from family is hard
enough. I see the time pass for my parents in their Facebook pictures
and on our Skype calls. As for here, W- is much older than I am, and I
want to make the most of the time that I have with him.

** Not optimizing for productivity

One of the people I was chatting with was interested in measuring
productivity. As I started thinking about it, I realized that I care
about making sure I’m not breaking many promises. Sometimes I slip up,
and then I know I have to slow down and take my time. I’m curious
about some things that might improve my effectiveness (dictation or
podcasting for these posts, to make the words flow better? automated
tests for my coding? visual vocabularies for my drawing?), but they
tend to be more qualitative than...

** Rediscovering the renaissance life :link:
"It must be nice

But my own favorite part of the book was in the description of the “Renaissance Man ideal”. This is the idea that you will have the most enjoyable life, AND the best chance at very early financial independence, by developing a whole load of interesting skills. The amazing part is that these skills don’t just sit independently in your mind like a bunch of unused kitchen appliances in a pantry. They start to reach out and connect to each other in unexpected ways, and start solving all of your problems for you. They build your curiosity and start sucking in still more skills that you can’t help acquiring. And before you know it, you are able to live a superb life on only a tiny fraction of the spending that a normal person does, even while you might end up accidentally earning money even more easily than before you embraced the Renaissance Ideal.

** Open loops :link:

It’s been more than ten years since David Allen published Getting
Things Done. I still haven’t come up with a fully trustable system,
but Emacs + Org + Evernote is getting there. I’m glad I’m back to
using Org. I’m starting to run into the reminders I set for important
business paperwork last year, and I might have missed that if I was
relying on my memory or my calendar.

From time to time, when I catch myself feeling frazzled, I stop and
write down all of my open loops: the things that tug on my attention.
Some of them must be ruthlessly demoted to “someday/maybe,” or even
let go. And then I can methodically go through the others, crossing
them off as I finish them. Getting it all down on paper helps me make
sense of things and stops me from feeling overwhelmed.

** Tool talk: Clipboard managers
Clipboard managers

Ditto - want more of a collection view
ClipMate - does not keep transparent backgrounds, but otherwise interesting collection management. Fixed transparency by enabling DIB and TIFF! Okay, we're good to go.

Decision criteria:
- must be able to organize clips into collections that don't get buried under new clips (can select collection)
- pen-friendly
- always-on-top


Stuf: transparent, good previous, but doesn't seem to have an always-on-top view

Clipboard Master: not transparent

Clipboard Fusion - can't handle images, I think

Try ClipMate because of the interface for selecting clips

Intended uses:
- Text for filenames
- Clipped images for pasting into a layer; not transparent, so darken only?

** Getting better at learning from online courses
* Connecting
** I like being introverted  :snippets:

Sometimes people tell me that they can’t believe I’m introverted. You
organize meetups, they say. You share a lot online. You can’t possibly
be introverted. Not only do I need to recharge after conferences or
other intense social interactions, I like being introverted – it’s
good to be comfortable with yourself. That said, you learn a lot when
you bump into other people, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to
have more of those serendipitous conversations.

I like group conversations more than one-on-ones because I get to
learn from the intersections of people’s interests. I see different
aspects of people than I might bring out on my own. Group
conversations also reduce the pressure to carry the conversation
myself – people bring their own questions and tips and ideas to the
table.

I’m particularly interested in virtual meetups because there are so
many wonderful people out there whom I will probably never be in the
same city with. Toronto is a great meetup city because there’s always
something going on, but there’s no reason why knowledge-sharing should
be unnecessarily privileged or limited by geographic proximity. If
people are curious about blogging, drawing, Emacs, Quantified Self, or
whatever we have in common, maybe we can have virtual show-and-tells
instead of relying on the probability of finding critical mass for a
meetup in our own areas.

---
I get my energy from a quiet and simple life. I’ve learned to say no
when I need more space: no if I need quiet instead of networking (even
if there could be someone who could change my life or vice versa just
over there); no if I need silence instead of a taxi cab conversation;
no to people’s requests in favour of spending time with W- or on my
own projects.

It’s hard to learn how to say no, or even to learn that you can. “Say
yes to everything,” the advice goes. Seize the day. Grab those
opportunities.

But there’s a lot of power in being able to listen to your needs and
carve out the time and space that you need—to meet the world on your
own terms, and to be happy to give because you’re ready to do so.

** Hacking my way into meeting people
I try to minimize the number of things I’ve promised to other people
so that I have the flexibility to follow opportunities when they come
up. Conversations are an exception. It’s hard to not schedule those if
I want to make sure they happen at some point. Left to my own devices,
I might never get around to talking to people. So I pay someone a
small amount to handle my scheduling, which neatly removes me from the
back-and-forth hassles of coordinating times and also (useful and
possibly more important!) prevents me from giving myself excuses not
to do it. Then I remind myself that getting to and from these
appointments is either reading time or free exercise (for in-person
meetings), or possible podcast or blog material (if online). Introvert
hack. =)

** Testing your assumptions
- Most important skill
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Assumptions are helpful
  - They simplify the world
  - They make it possible to make quick decisions. Making assumptions
    helps us take advantage of our past experiences, and we can learn
    from other people's experiences as well.
  - Otherwise, you'd get stuck verifying everything
- Why is it hard
  - Don't know your assumptions
  - Intimidated by measuring
  - Don't want to be wrong
  - Behaviour is hard to change.
- Time
  - Most likely the first thing you need to examine. If you always
    feel rushed for time, you won't have the space to question and
    explore your assumptions.

** DONE Homebody
   CLOSED: [2013-07-28 Sun 20:32]
Saturday afternoon. It had started raining, so W- put away his tools and stopped working on the deck stairs. He asked if I wanted to go out and do something fun – maybe watch a movie, or have pho? 

I checked the movie listings. Nothing particularly worth watching on the big screen instead of on our television, and we had food in the fridge. So we stayed home, watched one of the movies we’d checked out from the library, and enjoyed some home-made pizza.

We haven’t been to a movie theatre in ages (ever since I decided that actually, even superhero blockbusters are just fine on the small screen). The library is the source of a constant stream of DVDs. While there are long waits for the latest releases, there are plenty of old movies we can go through. I’ve gotten accustomed to watching with subtitles and the ability to pause or rewind, which is great since many movies involve at least one mumbly moment. Besides, if we watch at home, we can make jokes.

I am such a homebody. My default is to spend time at home, and I enjoy it. I love reading, writing, drawing, coding. Tidying up is slightly less fun, but it’s also useful. We’re not hermits – we go to the supermarket, the library, the hardware store – but we don’t often go out just for recreation.

I go out occasionally – more often than W- goes out. I go to the clients’ offices. I go to HackLab to hang out with other geeks and learn from them. I go to friends’ get-togethers. And then I come home and recharge.

Back when I lived at home, my parents took me and my sisters out a lot: eating at restaurants, strolling through the malls. I hardly go shopping here, aside from the occasional stressful sprint when I need to restock my shoes or clothes. I hardly go to restaurants, either. When I get together with friends, it’s usually in someone’s kitchen. 

I think the trick is to embrace it instead of wondering what other people are doing.

** OUTLINED No good or bad, just different
- Canada Post lost the passport that was sent through Xpresspost, so
  I need to go through the process of filing for a lost passport:
  official statement, police report, affidavit of
  loss, a rather high lost passport replacement fee, and another
  two months of waiting.

- I was not happy to find out they had lost my passport. I pouted and
  indulged in getting a few hugs from W-, who happened to be working
  from home at the time.

- Cheering up, I said, "I've never lost a passport before. Well, at
  least I get to learn how the process works!" I started singing,
  "Always look on the bright side of life..."

- "Okay, that's a bit of a stretch," W- said. But I think he was
  happy that I could bounce back easily. I know I was.

- Here is something I'm starting to learn about life: situations
  aren't bad or good, they're just different.
  
- Different is okay. I can deal with different.

- There's always something to be thankful for and something to learn
  from. In this case, I'm glad that we didn't book an August trip
  that we would have to cancel, and I'm glad that we have the space
  to deal with issues like this.
  
- There will be bigger challenges than this, so this is good
  preparation.

- wring out the most from it
  - go through the process
  - learn about it 
  - write notes
  - take advantage of the wait

(snippet from life)
Since she doesn’t like taking classes or workshops, she can use that
time to get better at teaching herself. I don’t like taking classes
either, so I know what that’s like. I should probably hack my way
around that, though. There are many things that might be more cost- or
time-effective for me to learn in a class than on my own or from
books.

maybe setting expectations?

When I project my current paths out to their peaks, I learn a lot about where I want to go and how I want to get there. For example, I'm currently learning about sales by selling sketchnoting services. I'm starting with that because it's relatively easy to appreciate (yay visuals!), there are established companies in other geographies that have tested the business model and value proposition, and people want it. There's a lot of room to grow. If I imagine being a super-sketchnoter or a super-illustrator, though, I feel like there's something missing. I feel like the focus is on interpreting someone else's ideas instead of creating something marvelous and new. Artists create new things, and there's something fascinating in that.

- Record rainfall, flooded power plant, rolling blackouts
- Power's back to normal, I think
- What I do in case of a power outage
  - Get the hand-cranked radio/flashlight from my emergency bag
  - Listen to AM radio while drawing or reading
  - Munch on shelf-stable food, like Skyflakes and hazelnut-chocolate spread
- Drawing from comic books and from life
- A little odd not looking things up on the Internet
- When I draw on paper, my hand gets tired faster.
- Checked out nearby library, but there were lots of people. Didn't
  need to eat out.
- Childhood: lots of power outages during the Cory Aquino
  administration in the Philippines
- I remember my mom would try to make sure we could sleep in the
  heat
  - sometimes fanning us herself
  - battery-operated fan, but she would still stay up and take care
    of us

    - When
      - Waking up
      - Walking around
      - Waiting in line

* 5-year experiment
** Learning how to be
This is probably the hardest part of semi-retirement: learning how to
be. Learning to let go of the need to check things off a list or do
things that I consider productive. Learning how to ignore the clock
and follow the flow.

Look, I'm writing a blog post instead of staring off into space. This
time, I'm not starting with an outline. We'll just see where this post
goes.

It's not all "work." I sleep in, and I go for walks, and I get on my
bike and go to places even if I don't need to. I cook and I read and I
garden. I tidy. I play video games.

They're still all verbs. That's okay. The goal isn't to do /nothing/,
the goal is to be where I am: unhurried, present, not frustrated, not
judging myself for what I do or don't do.

Pretty good, actually.

** What I'm learning from my 5-year experiment
- Rat race
- Discretionary time is a wonderful thing
- It's okay to not optimize everything
- There are lots of things I can learn (even without books or the Internet!)
** DONE The power of no: being completely* unhireable until 2017 (and possibly longer)

How to say no to opportunities

(Needs more work)

- When I started this 5-year experiment, I didn't know if I could
  stick with it. My track record for sticking with interests is not
  that good. I'm delighted to report that (semi-)retirement gets
  easier and easier. I am learning to say no.
- By coincidence, two of my mentors (who had moved on to separate
  companies after IBM) got in touch with me recently to find out if I
  was interested in some upcoming job opportunities. Good stuff.
  Right up my alley. Wonderful people.
- I said no. Actually, I said something along the lines of: Thank you
  for reaching out! That sounds fantastic. However, I am semi-retired
  and completely* unhireable for at least the next few years, so I'll
  just have to wish you good luck on your search. I'm sure you'll find
  someone awesome out there.
- (Of course, if a significant financial need comes up, I have no qualms about
  suspending this experiment and returning to the wonderful world
  of work. I enjoyed working with excellent teams. I'd love to do
  it again.
- Learning how to say no is incredibly amazing.
  - It helps to remember that there are other awesome people out there
    who can make things happen. 
  - Sure, they might not bring my particular configuration of skills,
    but they'll bring other useful combinations.
- I don't even have a tiny internal voice of dissent
  - because the part that might've been afraid about the future has
    been neatly shut up by a good if...then...else... that postpones
    consideration
- fine print
  - 
- in the meantime
  - pre-made decision tree
    - while things 
- comparative advantage
  - other people can do that work
  - not that many people can explore these opportunities
    - what: learning, sharing, following my curiosity, building a
      small and simple life
  - also, life is uncertain
    - so I should take advantage of this time 
- took all of August off
  - not travelling, not trying to build a business
  - learning skills: outlining, illustrating my posts
  - I like it.
- a year and a half into my experiment
- living expenses since 2012/03/01: average of $827 per month, or $801
  if I ignore travel - slightly below predictions, even!


** OUTLINED Experiment review: Income and expenses
- Preparation
  - Projecting my expenses
  - Main costs: $10k a year

  - Consulting
  - Easier and easier to substitute pleasures

- Keeping my needs small
- Lifestyle business
- More curious about life, creation - the things people can't pay you
  to do
- Backup plan
** Preparing for uncertainties

- Structure of 5-year experiment
- The more I try things out, the more I learn, the more I wander from
  my original plan
- Useful tool: imagine worst-case scenario
- http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/12/experiment-pre-mortem-imagining-and-dealing-with-causes-of-failure/

** Anticipating experiment outcomes
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I probably
  don't have to work again"?
  - Writing, drawing, coding based on my own interests
  - Sharing as much as possible
  - Open to receiving payment from other people as a way of funding
    more experiments - maybe tie value directly to experiments in a
    micro-Kickstarter sort of way?
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I want to
  'lean in' in terms of business?"
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I don't have
  to work a regular job again"?
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I want to go
  back to a regular job?"
  - Rebuild my network and dust off my resume
  - Probably go back to a technical position in a good team
