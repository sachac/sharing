#+TITLE: Sharing Outline
This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!
https://github.com/sachac/sharing , http://sachac.github.io/sharing/

Does a topic here intrigue you, or can you think of some useful
follow-ups ? E-mail me at [[mailto:sacha@sachachua.com][sacha@sachachua.com]] (or
file an issue, if you're geeky that way ;) ).

Inspired by anything? Feel free to write your own posts, and send me a
link. =)

<<thinkinglikeanemacsgeek>>

- *An approach for learning intermediate Emacs:* After you've gotten
  the hang of the basics, how can you keep learning more about using
  and tweaking this text editor? This will probably take different
  forms: small weekly tips for constant improvement, Emacs Lisp and
  Org Mode courses, and so forth.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to be an even better user of Emacs. I want to work more
    efficiently and fluently, and I want to have more fun with it too.
  - *Who might find it useful?* People who want to keep tweaking how
    they use Emacs. Mostly developers, but probably also writers and
    people interested in personal information management
  - *What is the change I want to help others with?* I want people to
    become confident about using Emacs for the long term. I want them
    to be able to play around with different mindsets/ideas, seeing
    the big picture instead of getting lost in lots of configuration
    details. I want to help people /think/ like an experienced Emacs
    user.
  - To do this, it would be good to read:
    - Archives of Emacs blogs (ex: the ones featured on
      http://planet.emacsen.org)
    - Manuals for Emacs, Emacs Lisp, and popular packages
    - the (small) collection of existing Emacs books
    - Related technical books for taking people beyond the beginner stage
    - Books about technical writing and learning design
    - Source code
  - What this book would be:
    - Different mental shifts/ideas, workflows; things people don't even think to search for
  - What this book is not:
    - How to write a package
    - Overloaded on specifics that will be obsolete or that are hard to get right for multiple platforms
  - Related
    - [[*Thinking with Emacs :book-idea:PROJECT:][Thinking with Emacs  :book-idea:PROJECT:]]
  - Possible titles
    - Emacs Mind
    - Thinking Like an Emacs Geek
    - ...

- *Think Like Emacs*
  - Why
    - What's the difference between a beginner Emacs user and an experienced one?
      - Beginner struggling with new concepts, frustrated with differences
      - Experienced Emacs users have a sense of where things are and how things fit together
    - In addition to learning new keyboard shortcuts and terms, you also need to make mental shifts
    - Invest time = compounding interest, long-term pay-off
    - As you become more comfortable with Emacs
    - You pick up new ways of thinking, aha!
    - Ideas for workflow as well
    - Community
  - Getting over the first barrier
    - Short-term learning challenge, long-term use
      - Other people are more interested in moving forward, I think
    - Keeping Emacs open, Emacsclient
    - Keyboard shortcuts; CUA, evil-mode, the Emacs Way
    - Terminology, glossary
      - Things that often trip people up
        - Buffer, window, frame
        - Yank, kill, kill ring
      - How to make sense of terms
    - Defaults and customization
    - Finding information
    - Self-documenting
  - Learning how to learn
    - Noticing an opportunity for improvement
      - Limited (ex: forgetting, mis-remembering)
      - Repetitive
      - Complex (distinguish from repetitive)
      - Rough
      - Open for customization
    - Learning slowly
      - Trying out new stuff
      - Keeping things manageable
        - Pick one thing
        - Sticky notes or index cards
      - Continuous improvement
      - Revisiting things you've learned
        - Digging deeper into packages and functionality

** Building your personal knowledge management system

- *A guide for creating your own personal knowledge management
  system:* I doubt that a one-size-fits-all solution will work, at
  least not with our current understanding. But I want to learn more
  about different approaches, I want to make mine totally awesome, and
  I want to help people build their own from the pieces that are
  already out there.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to have a wonderfully organized system that lets me easily
    capture, review, make sense of, and share what I know. I also want
    to have the vocabulary and concepts to be able to critically
    examine this system, spot gaps or opportunities for improvement,
    and make things better.
  - *Who would find this useful?* Fellow information packrats,
    writers, bloggers, self-directed learners
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Personal knowledge management and personal information management
    - Guides to using various tools
    - Information architecture
    - Library science
    - Writing and sense-making

** Self-directed learning and experimentation

- *Tips for self-directed learning and experimentation:* How to
  structure your time and learning, how to recognize and explore
  interesting questions, how to take notes, how to make sense of
  things, and so on. I want to learn more effectively, and I want to
  help other people learn more effectively too.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to be able to structure courses of study for myself, take
    great notes, build useful resources, and accumulate new knowledge.
  - *Who would find this useful?* Self-directed learners who want
    something more than online courses
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Quantified Self, experimentation
    - Note-taking and sense-making
    - Self-directed learning

** Working out loud
- *More notes on working out loud:* particularly addressing the
  excuses and barriers that get in people's way. To do this, it would
  be good to read about:
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to have a smooth workflow for learning and sharing. I want to
    have a wide network of people who can build on the stuff I'm
    learning about, and who get manageable updates that are scoped to
    their interests.
  - *Who would find this useful?* Individual practitioners interested
    in building their skills and network; social business advocates;
    bloggers who are also working on building personal insight and
    shared knowledge
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Social business, social learning, working out loud, personal
      learning networks, and personal knowledge management
    - Collaboration, team communication
    - Writing at work

** Visual thinking
- *Visual thinking:* particularly in terms of using it to clarify your
  thoughts, remember, and share. To do this, it would be good to read
  about:
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* After doing this, I
    want to be more fluent in using visual tools to explore thoughts
    and figure things out. I want to improve in terms of visual
    organization, technique, clarity, explanation, integration into my
    self-directed workflow, and so on.
  - *Who would find this useful?* People who've already started
    doodling (or who are picking up the hang of it) and who would like
    to use it for more things
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Mind mapping and other forms of visual organization
    - Sketchnoting
    - Planning
    - Blogging and other forms of personal publishing
    - Journaling
    - Information organization and sense-making

** Following the butterflies of your interest

- *Something about how to follow the butterflies of your interest*,
  because I rarely see this perspective in productivity books and
  because it's something other people might find helpful.
  - *What is the change I want to make in myself?* I want to get
    better at going with the grain of my energy, doing what I want to
    do (and doing the work that helps me want what is good to want).
  - *Who would find this useful?* People with many interests -
    scanners, multi-potentialites, Renaissance-people-to-be.
  - To do this, it would be good to read about:
    - Career and life planning, especially unconventional paths
    - Productivity
    - Writing, note-taking
    - Psychology, cognitive limits, distraction

    :END:

I have a friend who's focusing on learning how to ask better
questions. Actually, he realized his goal is probably to ask /more/
questions in the first place, since even simple questions ("Where did
you come from?") can lead to interesting stories.

It got me curious about getting better at learning from people. I
think this will help me learn about the stuff that I can't find in
books because:
- New things often aren't in books
- There's a lot of tacit knowledge that's difficult to capture
- Sometimes I don't understand something well enough to research it
- Talking to people can help me come across things I didn't know to ask about

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15714563274/][2015-01-20 Asking better questions -- index card #asking]]

I think getting better at asking questions and learning from people involves figuring out:
- what to ask about (spotting opportunities or following curiosities)
- who to ask
- how to build rapport
- how to pick the right time/place/sequence
- how to frame the question (level of detail, phrasing, etc.)
- how to follow up

So that gives me specific things to focus on in terms of learning from others and trying things out myself.

I've been thinking about two aspects of learning from
people: working with mentors/coaches/trainers, and having casual
conversations with other people.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16186736617/][2015-01-24 Imagining awesomeness at learning from people -- index card #learning #people]]

*Mentors/coaches/trainers*

I've been lucky to have many mentors (both formal and informal) who
helped me learn how to navigate organizations, find opportunities,
build skills, and so on. But I haven't been as deliberate about
learning as I could have been. I periodically consider finding a coach
for my writing or coding, but haven't taken the leap.

I've heard from people who weren't sure if therapy was working out for
them; they couldn't evaluate their progress. I think I'm hesitant for
similar reasons. I'm uncertain about choosing candidates, asking
useful questions, evaluating the results, and balancing the value and
the opportunity cost.

This is precisely the sort of situation for which an opportunity fund
is useful, because it pushes me to Just Try Things Out. I'm slowly
warming up to that idea, hence all the blog posts thinking out loud.

Here are some areas I'm considering:

- [[sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/breaking-skill-outlining/][How can I think in larger chunks?]]

- [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/sketchnote-hangout-playing-colour/][How can I draw with more colour and style?]]

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16150805919/][2015-01-19 Imagining an editing experiment -- index card egation #writing #editing]]

For example, an editing experiment might help me develop a better
mental model of an editor, forcing me to search for more specific
vocubulary (down with "stuff"!), testing to see if something I've
written makes sense, and checking for gaps.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16186736397/][2015-01-24 How can I learn from observation feedback -- index card #learning #people]]

In addition to directly asking for specific help, I might learn a lot
from general observation. A friend suggested Atul Gawande's /Better/
for its approach to learning: a surgeon inviting other surgeons to
observe him and give feedback, even though this technique was mostly
used by people with less experience. It makes sense to do that even
when you're more experienced, and it's probably even more useful
because people can swap tips or explain things they unconsciously do.

*Other people*

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15752626033/][2015-01-24 Mixed feelings about learning from people -- index card #learning #people]]

I noticed that I have a strong bias towards online conversations
instead of offline ones. Sure, online conversations might be
lower-bandwidth or not as nuanced. But blog posts and comments expand
the conversations to include other people, and it's easier to follow
up on threads of ideas. I think this preference is among the reasons
why, compared to several years ago, I now spend much less time going
to parties or meetups. Instead, I focus on writing and connecting online.

But I get plenty of writing time already, so maybe I should mix more
offline conversations into my life. This would follow the principle
that [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/10/hell-yeah-approaches/][I shouldn't always do what's fun and easy]]. It makes sense to
develop skills and routines in other areas as well. For example, I can
imagine getting better at cultivating acquaintances through shared
activities like cooking at Hacklab and hosting board game afternoons.
I can test and refine several quick stories for small talk, which
frees me up to focus on learning more about the other person through
questions. It's like the way foreign language learners can boost their
feeling of fluency by anticipating common questions ("Where are you
from?" "What do you do?") and practising answers to those.

I think that getting better at asking questions and learning from
people starts mostly from getting to know people as individuals. What
makes them different? What's interesting about their lives? There's
always something to find. The next step after that is to gradually
build the acquaintance or the friendship through things like lunches
or get-togethers. It makes sense to open my world so that I can come
across good people. I enjoy their company, I grow in helping out, and
I learn from the conversations with them and the mental models of
them.

*More thoughts*

Thinking about this, I realized that I'm not bad at learning from
people. I'm pretty good at learning from books, blogs, and online
conversations, which is why I rely on those so much. But there are
some aspects of learning from people that I can improve, and I can
play around with those without cutting too much into the time I spend
learning in other ways.

*** snippet: own questions
This push towards originality reminds me of how I've been drifting away from technical workshops, business conferences, and self-help books. When people teach other people in large, quick group settings or in traditionally-published books, it makes to go for a broad base. The more people you can help, the more affordable help is. Introductory material is easy to plan for, because you assume people are starting from scratch. Maybe they have no experience, or maybe they're tired of their old systems and are willing to start anew. If the market is sufficiently large, you might be able to plan for a slightly different profile: say, a Node JS tutorial for Ruby developers, or an Emacs tutorial for people shifting from SublimeText. For the most part, though, it's difficult to advantage of the skills students might be able to transfer from related fields. That's okay. The introductory stage is simply that. You just want to build competence.
When you get to the intermediate or advanced stages, though, instruction is harder, and learning is harder as well. No one hands you a curriculum to follow. You have your own goals and preferences, and you need to adapt or stitch together what you learn from other people. You need to come up with your own questions.

**** Learning more
  - Better: identify and make sense of relevant info; construct more knowledge (vs retrieving it)
  - Actually diving into documentation, experimentation, search
  - Learning from other people's thoughts
    - Do I usually jump to this state for non-technical stuff, or do I try to explore the question a little? It usually develops in a bit of a cycle

  - Better: Balance between personal notes (to keep the sense of figuring things out) and tips for other people (to help people learn things quickly)
  - Very little of this, since I want to get stuff out there quickly
  - Trust that future Sacha will pull together
  - YAGNI / lazy organization
**** Planning
***** Before you learn something, plan how you're going to apply it

***** Learn faster by breaking skills down
**** Making sense
***** How to understand what you're thinking

***** Learn holistically by organizing your thoughts

**** OUTLINED Collecting my thoughts, organizing them, identifying gaps
  - fascinated by how nonfiction writers organize their notes
    - nonfiction, because fiction writers have to deal with a whole 'nother kettle of fish
  - Better: Quickly pulling things together, identifying uncertainties or gaps, non-linearly organizing notes into a logical flow
  - What are the key challenges?
    - Finding a specific thing
    - Seeing the overall picture

  - How do other people do it?
    - question by question; forward, or backward

   - Taking notes: how to take notes, how to review your notes

 Beginner: do I need to cover this? maybe in its own post, or if people ask

 - picking a good direction to go in
   - doesn't have to be a complete, detailed plan
   - rough direction, idea of good/better/best
   - I like imagining wild success
   - also see if you don't actually want it strongly enough
 - figuring out what a few good next steps are - people often struggle with breaking things down into small, doable steps
   - too big: I don't have the time
   - too vague: I don't know where to start
   - too small: I don't see how this will help me get there
   - just right: let's try it!
 - checking to see if you're still going in the right direction, tweaking plans
   - keep track of ideas and next steps
   - review your notes
   - following up

 Intermediate:

 - taking notes, so you don't have to keep rediscovering things you've forgotten
   - questions for reflection
     - what are you doing?
     - how are you doing it?
     - what are you learning?
     - what are the next steps?
   - tools
     - paper journal; write down the date. If you're working on several topics, you might consider having one small notebook per topic, or using an index. [[http://blog.highfivehq.com/posts/a-little-known-hack-from-japan-to-get-your-notebook-organized][tabs]], or number your pages and keep an index at the back of the notebook.
     - I like using Evernote because I can add notes using my phone or my computer
   - finding the time
     - do it while you're learning
     - "I am going to ..."
     - clarifies your thoughts
     - helps you deal with interruptions and dead ends

 Advanced:

 - *seeing the connections and patterns over time* <- probably worth a post, since I want to dig into this myself
   - why
     - celebrate your achievements
     - check your progress
     - look for gaps and opportunities
     - make sense and solidify your understanding
   - rereading your notes
   - this is not as easy as collecting them, I think
   - comparisons: before and after (ex: a year)
   - summarizing: timelines, outlines
 - teaching other people
   - explaining things in your own words
   - organizing small steps into bigger, more logical chunks
   - teaching specific people vs teaching in the abstract
 - sharing with people
   - because you could save someone out there a little time on that
     same little step too, and if you multiply that by a thousand
     people, that's a lot of value

**** Intellectual goals                                           :subskills:
***** Excerpt
 The book /[[http://earlyretirementextreme.com/ere-book][Early Retirement Extreme]]/ (Jacob Fisker - CreateSpace: 2010)

 #+begin_quote
 Intellectual goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to:
 - Be able to quickly prioritize the relevance of information and be able to quickly research and find relevant information in many different areas. Learn independently and have an interest in doing so.
 - Have enough generalized knowledge to be able to understand the information and put it into the context of a mental framework, a model or procedure, and use it to ask further questions.
 - Recognize which problems the model applies to, take the solution to one problem, generalize it, and apply it to another problem.
 - Be able to critically analyze the model, refine it, and combine different models to achieve an objective. Practice critical thinking in all aspects of life to reach a degree of rational certainty. Be open to new ideas but do not accept anything uncritically.
 - Synthesize interdisciplinary information and laterally connect similarities which are not immediately apparent, discovering new models and procedures.
 - Evaluate different methods, models, and procedures while effectively ranking them for utility, and picking the best one while recognizing the pertinence of other methods. Pursue relevant and correct knowledge persistently and consistently. Master the fundamentals.
 #+end_quote

 This! I want to get better at all of these things. Based on feedback
 from my clients, I do pretty well already, prioritizing requests and
 potential resources, quickly cobbling together a tool from different
 pieces, and connecting the dots.

 But what would even better look like, and how do I inch closer to
 that?

 The more you know--the broader and deeper relevant knowledge you
 have--the easier it is to learn, since you have more resources for
 understanding and remembering new information. So the more I read and
 the more I try, the easier it is to learn.

 Subskills:
 - Figuring out what's relevant
 - Making sense of things
 - Figuring out how the pieces fit together
 - Recognizing the right nail when you have a hammer
 - Thinking about thinking
 - Connecting the dots
 - Choosing among strategies

**** Making better use of time
***** TODO Choosing what to think about on my subway commute

  - about 50 minutes
    - I often try to take this off-peak, so that I can avoid the rush and grab a seat.

  One of the ideas I'm picking up from /How to Live on 24 Hours a Day/
  (Arnold Bennett, 1910) is:

  #+begin_quote
  When you leave your house, concentrate your mind on a subject (no
  matter what, to begin with). ... By the regular practice of
  concentration (as to which there is no secret—save the secret of
  perseverance) you can tyrannize over your mind (which is not the
  highest part of you) every hour of the day, and in no matter what
  place. The exercise is a very convenient one. If you got into your
  morning train with a pair of dumb-bells for your muscles or an
  encyclopedia in ten volumes for your learning, you would probably
  excite remark. But as you walk in the street, or sit in the corner of
  the compartment behind a pipe, or “strap-hang” on the Subterranean,
  who is to know that you are engaged in the most important of daily
  acts?
  #+end_quote

  The idea is to practise concentration. Bennett suggests a little bit
  of Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus, who are both quite agreeable to me.
  =)

  What kinds of questions lend themselves well to being thought about
  while walking or taking the subway?

  - Base
    - Review my values, priorities, and actions
    - Review or make decisions
      - Non-trivial decisions with medium-term effects
    - Observe the world around me
      - Interesting products/services/needs/thoughts?
  - When I can read
    - Read technology resources in order to learn more about tools I can use
    - Review my sketchnotes and blog posts in order to revisit thoughts
    - Review other people's sketchnotes in order to build my visual vocabulary and develop my eye
    - Read and save blog posts from my subscriptions
  - When I can write
    - Write a journal entry observing what happened that day, and then reflect on it
    - Play around with blog post ideas
      - Not outlining because of difficulty of text manipulation
      - Maybe coming up with titles and some rough notes
    - Answer quick e-mails

  Find myself spinning unless I have a way to slow down my thoughts
  - writing

- Currently type ~108wpm on Dvorak
    - Type faster and rely on autocorrect and editing to fix errors?
    - Use speech recognition?
        - Easiest startup, extra benefits for dictating book notes and transcribing my own stuff
        - Highest frustration
    - Learn Colemak for same-hand optimization?
        - Closest to Dvorak in terms of how I use my computer
        - Because it's close, I get the most confusion; sigmoid curve?
        - Colemak FAQ says stick with Dvorak if you're already happy with it
        - Maybe I should play with this incremental approach? http://forum.colemak.com/viewtopic.php?id=1684
        - Hah, maybe I should see about making my Dvorak home row close to
        - Big selling point of Colemak: similar to QWERTY, common shortcuts stay the same.
            - Emacs has different shortcuts anyway
            - and I've gotten used to where things are
            - and also, normal Ctrl-x, Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v suck because you get tempted to do them on the same hand
        - No
    - Learn Plover (stenography) and much higher WPM?
        - My keyboard doesn't handle some of the chords well
        - Phonetic, so...
    - Draw pictures instead (work on getting even better at communicating concisely?)
    - Bottleneck is not typing speed; improve thinking speed somehow?
- Three cases
    - Outlining
        - Uses a lot of keyboard shortcuts, so Dvorak or Colemak would be better than Plover or speech recognition

            - Computer
            - Paper
    - Turning an outline into a blog post
        - Current workflow involves a lot of editing and deleting, so speech recognition and Plover are less useful
        - Speech/Plover might be more useful if I'm typing into a separate buffer
    - Capturing notes from books (quotes, outlines)
- Decision
    - Focus on improving speech recognition accuracy by dictating book notes
    - Try more tweaks to current keyboard layout (ex: mapping left control to Backspace)
    - Experiment with using speech recognition to draft e-mails and blog posts

 - Background
     - Grew up with a computer
     - Learned how to type long before I had computer or typing classes
     - Bad habits
     - One summer, I decided to learn Dvorak. dvorak7min
     - More than ten years ago
     - I type faster and more comfortably in Dvorak than in QWERTY.
     - Also, it keeps people off my laptop and adds to my reputation for geek weirdness.
 - Why
     - Curious about computer-based optimization
         - Rolls
     - Keep my brain flexible
     - Learn about learning
     - Possibly get faster?
         - Trade-offs
 - Nudged by http://kevinercia09.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/five-for-typing/

     - Install support for it
     - Try different typing tutors

         - http://keybr.com - better interface
         - http://colemak.com/TypeFaster - working on this because the lessons are built in
 - Day 1 (Sept 20, 2013) - two hours
   - Went through the first six lessons of Learn Colemak (I still need to learn the bottom row)
   - Tried out keybr's random words level 1 - dismal 14wpm
   - 23wpm on lesson 1 for Type Faster - a slightly more encouraging 23wpm

*** Alchemy



Some plans don't work out.

Writing helps me make sense.
*** Write more useful weekly, monthly, and yearly reviews by thinking about your goals

- yearly
  - many people take time to reflect
  - hard to remember each month
    - pictures
    - notes
  - why
    - revisit your predictions and decisions
- monthly
  - if you work at an organization with an annual performance review, it's good to take notes on your achievements and skills
- weekly
  - clear your mind




  I love how a calendar change gets so many people in the mood for
  reflection, tallying up the past year and looking ahead to the new
  one. A year is [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/building-better-time-machine/][enough distance to look at your past self]] and notice
  things that aren't obvious day to day. You can revisit your
  predictions and the outcomes of decisions that unfold over time, as
  suggested by Peter Drucker in [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/09/sketchnote-managing-oneself-peter-drucker/]["Managing Oneself"]]. It's a good time
  to celebrate any progress you've made and gently bring yourself back
  on track where you've drifted off it. With time and attention, you
  can [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/sketched-book-inner-game-work-w-timothy-gallwey/][guide your awareness]] to the things you want to accomplish and
  question the things you've glossed over.

  If I've been doing my weekly and monthly reviews well, there should
  be no surprises. But still, I forget so many things - my [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/12/learning-effectively-exploring-various-unknowns/][unknown
  knowns]]. An annual review won't save them from the fog, but it might
  help me connect more ideas. And I can think deliberately about the
  things I want to learn and the kind of person I want to grow into,
  which makes it easier to ask questions and gradually transform my
  day-to-day life.

  Taking a step back lets you see how far you've come -- and how much
  other people have helped. Sharing your steps forward might help you
  bump into co-adventurers so that you can swap tips. And then there's
  the public commitment of saying, "Hey, this is what I'm doing this
  year." Sometimes that's enough to push you into actually doing it.

  So reviews are great for past and future, and they're good for
  capturing the present, too: a snapshot of life, a sketch of your
  routines and thoughts to help you look back after decades blur.
  Other people take pictures. I like writing.

It's
  good for being able to empathize with people; otherwise, it can be
  hard to remember that you were ever anything but who you are now.

*Instead of using a generic title (ex: Top 10 Ways to ...), pick your strongest point and put that in the title as a clear recommendation.*

Now that I've gotten that promised tip out of the way, here's the
reflection that prompted this post.

Many bloggers focus on improving their titles as a way to encourage
people to click or share. Having repeatedly [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/writing-open-loops-closed-loops-working-forgetfulness/][run into the limitations]]
of my blog searches and [[http://sachachua.com/index][index]], I've been thinking about blog post
titles as a way to make my blog posts more memorable - both in terms
of *retrieval* (remembering what to look for) and *recognition*
(recognizing it when I come across it).

That's why many of the usual title-writing tips don't appeal to me,
even if they're backed by [[http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-attract-more-clicks-blog-posts-title-tests-list][A/B testing]]. List posts? A focus on new or
exclusive information? Mysterious headlines? While writing a post
called "10 New Emacs Productivity Tricks That Will Make Vim Users Hate
You - #2 Will Save You Hours!" is tempting to consider as an April
Fool's Joke, that kind of title is useless for me when I'm trying to
find things again. Any title generic enough to come out of a [[http://tweakyourbiz.com/tools/title-generator/index.php][blog post
title generator]] is too generic for me to remember.

Fortunately, there are plenty of role models on the Web when it comes
to writing clear, specific blog post titles. [[http://lifehacker.com/][Lifehacker]] somehow
manages to do this well. Most of its posts start with a verb, even
when linking to a post that doesn't, and yet it doesn't feel
overbearing.

Here's a sample of Lifehacker titles for posts that summarize and link
to other posts (ignoring posts that were original guides, product
links, or fully-reposted blog posts):

Fascinating. Of the nine posts I looked at, all of them rewrote the
titles from the original blog posts so that they started with a verb,
making the titles more specific in the process. This makes sense in
the context of it being a lifehack, of course. The concept has action
at its core.

I like the new titles more. I can imagine that remembering and linking
to the Lifehacker-style titles would be easier than linking to the
original ones.

Most of my posts don't quite feel like those, though. I noticed that
most of my titles start with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund][gerunds]]: thinking about, building,
learning, exploring, experimenting. I think it's because I write in
the middle of things, while I'm figuring things out. I don't feel
comfortable telling people what they should do. I share my notes and
let people come to their own conclusions. Starting a post with a verb
seems to be too direct, as if I'm telling you to do something.

That said, filler phrases like "Thinking about..." aren't particularly
useful as part of a title, since the reflection is a given. But
changing "Thinking about how to make better use of Yasnippet in my
Emacs workflow" to "Save time with dynamic Yasnippets when typing
frequently-used text in Emacs" doesn't seem to accommodate the
exploratory bits, although it could be a good follow-up post. Changing
"Minimizing upward or downward skew in your sketchnotes" to "Minimize
upward or downward skew in your sketchnotes" feels like I'm making a
value judgment on skewed sketchnotes, when some people might like the
fact that an upward skew tends to feel happy and optimistic.

So I use nouns or gerunds when reflecting (which is self-directed),
and verbs when I'm trying to put together other-directed advice. This
helps me differentiate the types of posts in my index and in my
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/09/working-with-the-editorial-calendar-plugin-for-wordpress/][editorial calendar admin screen]], and it also signals the difference to
people as they browse. You might not be interested in my reflections
and prefer to focus on tips, for example, or you might be tired of
tips and want journal entries instead.

That works because those types of posts are generally quite separate.
When I want to help someone learn a technique such as [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/08/sketchnoting-tutorial-banners-and-ribbons/][sketching quick
ribbons]], I don't go on an extended tangent about how I learned how to
do that or how I want to improve. When I'm thinking about how I can
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/rethinking-delegation/][improve my delegation skills]], I don't expect someone to patiently go
through all of that in search of three concrete tips to help them
improve. I think that as I gain experience and become more opinionated
(the latter probably being more related to this), I'll write more
advice/instruction posts, possibly linking to those
personal-experience-and-reflection posts instead of going on internal
tangents.

In this post, I'm experimenting with a verb title while doing
extensive self-reflection. It feels a little odd, as if you started a
conversation with someone and then proceeded to talk to yourself, idly
musing out loud. You'll have to tell me if I should never do that
again, or if there's a way to manage the balance.

I figure there are plenty of other people out there who want to tell
you what to do with your life, and I'm not completely fond of that
approach anyway.

But I want to do *something* with my titles so that I don't end up
with lots of "Thinking about ..." and "Exploring ..." and "Deciding
between ..." in my index. My ideal for these reflection posts, I
think, would be a clear, concise summary of the key insight (perhaps
saving it as an excerpt). If I followed that up with an other-directed
post with a crisp title that started with a verb, made the
recommendation, brought in some research and observations, and linked
to my reflection, that would give me a good, logical, memorable,
useful chunk that I could share with other people.

Right. That makes sense to me. If I address you with a direct verb or
"How to ...", I should deliver a post that requires minimal mental
translation for you to get good tips out of it. If I clearly mark
something as a reflection, you know what to expect. I tend to remember
them as actions I decided to take ("The time I resolved to...") or the
particular new thing I came to understand. I can take a few minutes to
update the titles and summaries accordingly, which could help me years
later when I'm trying to make sense of things again.

In Buckminister's rather odd book /I Seem to Be a Verb/ (1970), he wrote:
#+begin_quote
I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I
am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an
evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.
#+end_quote

A verb seems too definite for me. I'm a gerund in at least two senses,
I think: reflexive, the way "I read" is an act but "reading" is a noun
that lets us talk about itself; and in the process of doing, not done.

*I think I've written about something before, but I can't find it.* I
have thirteen tabs open with Google search results from my blog.
I've tried countless keywords and synonyms. I've skimmed through
posts I only half-remember writing. (Was that blog post really that
short? I thought I wrote more details.) I still haven't found the
post I want.

I wonder: *Did I really publish it?* Or did I just outline or sketch
it? Am I confusing it with something similar that I wrote, or
someone else's post that I admired?

*Ah, well, time to write it from scratch.* It's a little like writing
code. Sometimes it would take so long to find an appropriate open
source module that you're better off just writing the code yourself.
Sometimes it would take so long to find an existing post that it's
better to just write it from scratch.

I was looking for that particular post because of a conversation with
Flavian de Lima where I mentioned the benefits of blogging while
you're learning something. He resonated with the idea of sharing your
notes along the way so that other people can learn from them, even if
you've moved on to different topics.

Despite having a clear memory of writing about this topic, when I went
to the post that I /thought/ was related to it ([[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/spiral-learning/][spiral learning]]), it
didn't mention blogging at all. [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/01/share-learn/]["Share while you learn"]] didn't quite
address it, either. After trying lots of searches, I gave up and
started writing a new post. After all, *[[http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/18/health/lifeswork-loftus-memory-malleability/index.html][memories are fallible]]*; you
could have full confidence in an imagined event.

The reason this came up was because Flavian described how he often
took advantage of *open loops* when working on writing. He would stop
with an incomplete thought, put the draft away, and let his
subconscious continue working on it. Sometimes it would be days or
weeks before he got back to working on the article. He mentioned how
other authors might take years to work on novels, dusting off their
manuscripts and revising scenes here and there.

*Keeping loops open by stopping mid-sentence or mid-task* is a useful
technique often recommended for writing or programming. Research
describes this as the [[http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Zeigarnik_Effect][Zeigarnik effect]]: an interrupted task stays in
your memory and motivates you to complete it.

But after reading David Allen's /Getting Things Done/, I had become
a convert of *closed loops*: getting tasks, ideas, notes out of your
head and into a trusted system so that you don't have to waste
energy trying to remember them. I noticed that if I kept too many
loops open, my mind felt buzzy and distracted. To work around this,
I got very good at writing things down.

I even took it one step further. Publishing my notes on my blog helped
me get rid of the guilt and frustration I used to feel whenever I
found myself wanting to move on to a different project. Because my
notes were freely available for anyone who was trying to figure out
the same thing, I could go ahead and follow the butterflies of my
interest to a different topic. My notes could also help me pick things
up again if I wanted to.

I didn't stop mid-sentence or mid-thought, but *I published in the
middle of learning* instead of waiting until I finished. Even my
review posts often included next steps and open questions. So I got a
little satisfaction from posting each small chunk, but I still left
dangling threads for me to follow up on. I closed the loops enough so
that the topics didn't demand my attention.

*Writing helped me clear my mind of strong open loops--but it worked a
little too well*. I tried to close things off quickly, so that I could
revisit them when I wanted to. The trick was remembering that they
were there. Sometimes I forget the dangling threads for a year or
more. I never followed up on others. Even with my regular review
processes, I often forgot what I had written, as in the search that
prompted this post.

Writing and memory have an ancient trade-off. Even Socrates had
something to say about it in Plato's /The Phaedrus/:

#+begin_quote
...for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the
learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories; they will
trust to the external written characters and not remember of
themselves.
#+end_quote
as quoted in [[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2012/04/30/on-writing-memory-and-forgetting-socrates-and-hemingway-take-on-zeigarnik/][On writing, memory, and forgetting: Socrates and Hemingway take on Zeigarnik]]

In 2011, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_effect][Sparrow, Liu,
and Wegner]] showed that people remember less if they think a computer
will keep their notes for them, and they tend to remember how to get
to the information rather than the information itself. Having written
the words, published the posts, and indexed the titles, I've forgotten
the words; and now I can't find my way back.

Hence my immediate challenge: *sometimes I forget how to get to the information I've stored*, like a squirrel stashing nuts.
(More research: [[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/11/981126102802.htm][tree squirrels can't find 74% of the nuts they
bury]]. So I'm doing slightly better than a squirrel, I think.)

Google helps if I can remember a few words from the post, but since
it tends to search for exact words, I have to get those words right.
Hah, maybe I need to use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques
like writing with different keywords -- not for marketing, but for
my own memory. It reminds me of [[http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/01/twitters-best-joke-an-seo-copywriter-walks-into-a-bar/69419/][this SEO joke]]:

#+begin_quote
How many SEO copywriters does it take to change a lightbulb, light bulb, light, bulb, lamp, bulbs, flowers, flour...?
#+end_quote

My [[http://sachachua.com/index][blog index]] is helpful, but it isn't enough. I need to write more descriptive titles. Perhaps I should summarize the key point as well. [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/11/mapping-what-im-learning/][Maps]] can help, as can other [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/deliberately-making-sense/?shareadraft=baba27724_549b4095bcbe4][deliberate ways of connecting ideas]].

*Let me take a step back and look at my goals here.* Linking to posts
helps me save time explaining ideas, build on previous
understanding, and make it easy for people to dig into more detail
if they want. But I can also accomplish these goals by *linking to other people's explanations*. With so many people writing on the Web,
chances are that I'll find someone who has written about the topic
using the words I'm looking for. I can also *write a new post from scratch*, which has the advantages of being tailored to a specific
question and which possibly integrates the forgotten thoughts even
without explicit links.

It's an acceptable trade-off, I think. *I'll continue writing, even
with the increased risk of forgetting.* If I have to write from
scratch even when I think I've probably written about the same topic
before, I can accept that as practice in writing and thinking.

Other writers have better memories. Flavian told me how he can
remember articles he wrote in the 1990s, and I've heard similar
accounts from others. Me, I've been re-reading this year's blog posts
in preparation for my annual review, and I've come across ones that
pleasantly surprised me. Posts two or three years back are even
fuzzier in my memory. I can try to strengthen my memory through
exercises and processes. The rest of the time, I can work with the
brain that I have. In fact, I'm inclined to build more memory
scaffolds around myself,
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/02/moving-my-memory-outside-my-brain/][moving
more of my memory outside my mind]].

#+begin_quote
[I do not] carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books. ...The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think.
#+end_quote
- [[http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein][Albert Einstein]], as Wikiquotes cites from /Einstein His Life and Universe/ (2007)

And really, how much difference would perfect memory make? I might add
more links, include more citations, cover more new ground. I can still
learn and share without it.

Forgetful squirrels have their uses. Forgotten acorns grow into oaks
for others to enjoy. From time to time, I hear from people who've come
across old posts through search engines, or I come across old posts in
a review. Loops re-open, dangling threads are taken up again, and we
continue.

       5. Collections and summaries; pointers to people
       6. Behind the scenes; working out loud
  2. Research, learning, and summarization
     1. Learning from other people's experiences, saving people time
        1. quotes from books or visual summaries, so people can go and find out more
        2. links to blog posts, so people can explore
     2. Learning from my own experiences
        1. start (groundwork)
        2. middle (preliminary observation)
        3. end (wrap-up, next step)
  3. Right-size chunk, especially in terms of blogging
     1. Too small: no action to take, no movement forward
     2. Too big: massive, hard to remember, intimidating to act on
     3. Just right: clear action and useful discussion
  4. Logical flow, permutations   <- worth a blog post focusing on just this?
		 - [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/breaking-skill-outlining/][Breaking down the skill of outlining]]
     1. Why
        1. Not just about linking verbs - tried looking for resources on improving logical flow.
           1. Looks promising: /Structure & Flow: How to Focus, Organize and Unify All Types of Magazine Articles to Hold Your Reader from the Lead to the End/ (David A. Fryxell, 1996)
        2. Things that don't have obvious structure
        3. What do I mean by "hangs together beautifully"? Where can I find examples of this? Hmm, let me review.
           1. Do I save a lot of blog posts because they are well-written, or do I care about the idea first?
           2. Okay. I mostly care about the idea and less about the structure, so maybe this is less important to me.
           3. Slate Star Codex has long blog posts that are more structured than mine. Scott H. Young, too.
        4. *I make jumps because I take things for granted*
        5. Feels more coherent, more polished
        6. Minimize cognitive load
        7. Encourage people to read and to apply thoughts
     2. Why not
        1. Magnitude of the benefit? Other places to focus on, like inter-post organization
     3. Mediocre: List posts, posts I write mostly linearly
     4. Average: Posts I write with an outline
     5. Good: Posts where I've tested the flow with other people to
        see if it makes sense to have one connect to the other and to
        see what I'm missing
        1. I'll always be missing /something/, because people will
           have different experiences and background knowledge.
        2. But it's good if I can address /one person/'s gaps; expectation if I write something in response to someone?
        3. Fixing gaps
           - Small gaps: Add a little more text, or remove dangling strings
           - Larger gaps: Use links to fill in the details
     6. Logical orders - managing information overload?
        1. Random
        2. Importance - but I don't often know what's important
        3. Alphabet
        4. Chronology / *prerequisites*. Tip from On Writing Well (I think it's from that one) - working backwards from questions
        5. Alphabetic pattern or abbreviation - Hard to pull off well. Can seem artificial, consultant-y (where's that lovely blog post I saw about that?) http://blog.ideatransplant.com/2014/12/3-things-with-3-things-each.html
           #+begin_quote
           Management consulting stories are always divided in 3 or 5
           components (optimally starting with the same letter), and
           each of these is then divided into 3 sub components as
           well. Connect, communicate, control. And to achieve connect
           we need to aggregate, accumulate, and accelerate. ... Using
           too many words that start with a C make you sound like a
           consulting report, not like a genuine speaker.
           #+end_quote
           sounds too contrived, like you spent some time with a thesaurus trying to figure out a good fit.
     7. Tools
        1. Practice: Reassembling sentences from model essays - Benjamin Franklin; computer tool for doing so? Maybe something in Emacs?
           1. How would I implement this in Emacs? Take text and split it
              up into sentences. Use diff to compare it against the
              checked-in version. Can sort lines to reorganize. Org lets
              you transpose lines easily.
              1. TODO: Pick sample: Stoicism, or On Writing Well, or blog posts I really like from my round-ups? Probably from blogs, since they have a different format and rhythm compared to nonfiction books.
              2. TODO: Write blog post about this
              3. Ah. Quotes are too small. Maybe I should keep track of tables of contents in my notes.
        2. Permuting my own?
        3. Feedback?
           1. How can I get more developmental feedback from readers?
           2. Outsourced editing feedback tends to be copyediting instead of logical flow
        4. Outlines
           1.

 - As an introvert, I don't want to impose on other people
   - I'm somewhat okay with blog reading being completely voluntary
   - This is why I haven't gotten around to e-mail newsletters yet, even though reading is voluntary too.
   - Maybe I don't have to?
 - I want most of my posts to be *useful.*
 - I don't want to be generic. What's the point of writing something you could just find on Lifehacker? So I tell stories about what I'm learning.
 - What I want to avoid:
   - Article mills
   - Me-me-me-blah-blah-blah
 - But there are good examples
   - Lifehacker tends to be impersonal
   - The Simple Dollar is a little closer to the impersonal side of things, but is sprinkled with personal stories
   - Penelope Trunk and Mel Chua write more personally than I do
     - What makes their blogs feel more personal?
       - Penelope Trunk writes about more stresses and difficulties.
     - Mel's writing communicates her excitement and passion
   - Mr. Money Mustache is a great mix of useful + personal.

*** Other post


 Also, another note from 2004: My notes were shorter and more plentiful
 back when I didn't think of it as a blog, just my notebook. That could
 be handy to bring back. But I like the depth of exploring an idea in a
 longer post, and I like the way sketches help me build up to more
 complex ideas too. Perhaps a tidbits category that's not included in
 the stream, a combination of a web log and features à la BoingBoing
 (although not as awesome)? One thing I've learned in the past ten
 years is that if it isn't public, it's hard to remember or keep.

 # <<blogging-skills>>
 [[http://sach.ac/outline#blogging-skills]]

 Here's my evolving break-down of blogging-related skills, including
 notes for future blog posts. I'm currently working on getting better
 at *outlining* (from high-level down to chunks of ~100 words)
 and *synthesizing* (especially combining other people's insights with
 my experiences). I'm using this outline to think of ways to
 deliberately practise certain aspects of blogging, to plan posts that
 will help people learn, and to clarify what I would like to delegate
 to assistants or work with coaches for.

 - Proofread
 - Edit
 - Look for an image

         - Why? It's not just a blog post, it's the learning

*** OUTLINED Think about your blogging goals and how your posts align with them :data:

    :END:

 I've been thinking about my goals for blogging because I want to get better. I write almost every day, fueled by habits of reading and experimenting. I have time to learn things, and I can learn more effectively if I learn deliberately. Here's what I'm learning about being clear about your goals and analyzing how your actions match up with them.

**** 1. Clarify your goals

 It's good to know what your goals are and how the different approaches serve those goals so that you can choose the ones that are the most effective. You can also look at each approach to see how you can improve it.

 After some reflection, I came up with this list of goals for my blog:

     1. Learn more effectively by thinking through complexity or explaining what I'm learning
     2. Explore assumptions and possibilities; become more aware of them myself, and help other people see them
     3. Improve core skills through practice: making decisions, explaining ideas, organizing thoughts, etc.
     4. Save myself and other people time spent re-solving the same problems or learning the same things
     5. Build a long-term archive that I can use to remember what I'm learning and see differences over time
     6. Learn from other people through questions, comments, and conversations

 Your list of goals will probably look different. Many people have goals such as building a business by promoting their products or services, educating clients or readers, keeping family members up to date, working through difficult issues by writing anonymously, and so on. Take a moment to think about and prioritize your goals.

 If you're having problems expressing your goals, you can also take a look at your recent blog posts and ask yourself, "Why did I write this?" What results did you want to get? What purpose did it serve? One blog post might work towards several different goals.

**** 2. Analyze the ways you approach those goals

 Different actions support different goals to different extents. Think about the different types of blog posts you write. Score them against each of your goals on a scale of 1 to 5, where a score of 5 means that type of post helps a specific goal a lot, while 1 means it does very little or even nothing for that particular goal.

 Here are some of the types of posts I share and how they line up with the goals I listed above:

     |                                                     | Goal 1: Learn | Goal 2: Explore | Goal 3: Improve | Goal 4: Save time | Goal 5: Build | Goal 6: Learn from others | Total |

   #+TBLFM: $8=vsum($2..$7)

 Sorting the table by the total score makes it easy to see which approaches you value more. If some goals are much more important to you than others, you can also weight those goals in your calculations. For example, if building a long-term archive was twice as important to me, I could double that column when calculating the total score.

 Anyway, this ranking makes it clearer why I feel good about original drawings and sketchnotes, and why I skew towards decision reviews and "thinking through things"-type posts even if they don't feel focused enough on saving other people time. Most of the blogging advice tends to focus on writing tips, but they don't motivate me as much.

 How about you? Do your post types match up with your goals? Are there clear winners that you should focus on? You can write lower-value posts from time to time because they address different needs. For example, I post weekly reviews because they're useful to me even if they're less useful for others.

**** 3. Adjust your priorities based on feedback

 Of course, since these values are subjective, it helps to adjust them based on your website analytics or feedback from your readers. For example, if you think a type of post saves people a lot of time, you'll probably see a lot of visits or comments on it. If you have Google Analytics, you can export the *Content - Site Content - All Pages* table to a spreadsheet, classify the top X links, and then see what types of posts people spend their time on. For example, I analyzed the top 500 pages visited in July 2013, classified each by type, calculated average views and time per page, and sorted it by average views to get a sense of which posts tend to be more popular.

 | Post type                  | Number of pages | Number of views | Average page views per page | Average minutes per page view | Average bounce rate |

 My sketchnotes are more popular by far. My technical notes are surprisingly durable over time, even though you'd expect them to be superseded by bugfixes, technical changes, better documentation, and so on. Posts as old as 2004 still turn up. Because people still get a lot of value from my old tech posts, I adjusted the "Save time" rating for tech tips from my original value of 3 to 4. (I had started with a lower value because I figured that not a lot of people would probably have run into the same issues I did, but it turns out that time makes up for audience size and the long tail works.) As I expected, tips that few other people have written about get more pageviews than tips that more people have written about, although I'm surprised that people tend to spend more time on the common tips. My "thinking out loud" posts are more popular than I expected. (Limitations: This only looks at single-page views in a single month.) Also, people tend to click on my weekly reviews if I add a brief description to the title, so that's something.

 Anecdotally speaking, I get a lot of comments and links to my sketchnotes. I'm also delighted by the conversations that occasionally grow out of the "thinking out loud" posts, and how sometimes people will share even better solutions when I post my technical notes.

**** 4. Identify ways to improve each approach

 Now that you've looked at what makes each type of post different, you can focus on how to improve each type by building on its strengths or compensating for its weaknesses. Here's what I'm planning for the kinds of posts I write:

 *Draw original stuff*: It takes me 2-4 hours to make one of these. I like making technical notes (ex: Emacs), sketchnote tutorials (to help people draw more), and other drawings related to life and planning. I'm getting used to drawing them with less up-front planning. Even though I end up moving things around, I think it's useful to just get started. Drawing involves a trade-off because images are not as searchable as text. I can fix that by including the text, but it's a little awkward and it takes more time. Still, people like the drawings a lot, and I like them too.

 *Draw book reviews and events:* I go to fewer events these days, but I'm reading a lot more books. It takes me two hours to read a typical business book in depth, drawing notes along the way. I tend to draw book reviews only when I've already gotten a sense that a book is worth reading in depth. One way to increase my frequency is to draw book notes based on the skimmed parts of books that I'm not reading deeply - perhaps breaking out just the chapter or idea that resonates with me, and using that to illustrate a blog post reflecting on it. I can also work on getting more high-quality books into my pipeline, or practise by drawing more books with fewer value judgments.

 *Think out loud:* I can improve the "Save time" score by stashing the notes in my outline, adding observations, until I've fleshed it out enough for preliminary findings and advice. It means that the output will be more concise in its reasoning and I'll have to do more learning on my own instead of opening up the conversation early, but then the posts will be useful for other people as well as for me. [[http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/][Mr. Money Mustache]] is a good example of a blog that mixes personal stories and useful observations. The main thing that was holding me back from doing this before was losing track of my drafts, but my outline is a good step.

 For example, this post started as a rough outline, thinking out loud about what kinds of posts I wanted to write. Now I'm going back and filling it in with other information that might be useful for people. If it ends up too long, I might have to trim it. We'll get there!

 *Share tech tips, troubleshooting notes, or code:* The limiting factor here is that I'm not working on any professional projects that I can write about, so I'm forced to run into and resolve fewer issues. I can replace that with working on my own projects or on open source projects, or helping people with questions. I often tweak or work on things related to Emacs, Wordpress, or data visualization, so there's that. If I set aside time and find a good source of small bugs so that I can ease my way into a habit of contributing to open source again, then that will also help me with my life goal to keep my technical skills sharp.

 *Review longer spans of time:* I can increase the frequency of decision reviews by scheduling them so that I don't lose track of items. Because I manage my outline in Org Mode, that should be relatively easy to do. I can also bootstrap this by reviewing last year and last decade's monthly reviews (if available), or the blog posts if not. I have an advantage here because I have a lot of public notes over the years.

 *Write tips that few other people can cover:* There are lots of information gaps to fill. Sometimes it's because people don't have the time, inclination, or confidence to write about something. Sometimes it's because I have a useful combination of skills or I can bring a different perspective. If I can't find information, that's a good reason to write it.

 *Write tips that other people can also cover:* The world doesn't really need another "how to find the time to blog" tutorial. If I can filter through search results for a good one and make it more findable, that beats writing one from scratch--unless I can add something special or relate different types of advice to each other.

 *Review recent posts (weekly, monthly):* These are low-value in the short term (mostly lists of links, plus the nudge to do my weekly planning process), but I've found them to be surprisingly useful over the years. They also help keep my large blog archive manageable. That's why I keep posting them. I've started using the weekly and monthly reviews to give people [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/how-i-use-feedburner-to-give-people-the-option-of-different-blog-update-frequencies/][less-frequent subscription options]] (daily can be a little overwhelming), so that's helpful too.

**** Wrapping up

 "Get better" is a vague goal. If you can identify the specific goals you would like to work toward, different ways to move towards those goals, and specific actions you can take to improve those approaches, you'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of growing. You'll find it easier to recognize or create opportunities to grow, and you can track your progress along the way. You might also be able to identify counter-productive approaches and replace them with ones that move towards more of your goals. Good luck and have fun!

*** OUTLINED Update: What I want my blog to become

 - I took a month off from my two-days-a-week consulting gig so that I
   could experiment with focusing on writing.
 - I want to be all-the-way-retired. There's a chance I might be. I'm
   not sure.
 - Most writers don't even have this luxury: to write about whatever
   they want to write, without worrying about whether the book will be
   picked up by a publisher or whether the magazine will accept the
   article.


 - The M word: Monetization
     - I thought about what I would use more money to do
       http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/05/on-blogging-and-platforms-and-experimenting-with-google-hangout/
         - I wouldn't change my lifestyle all that much
         - More money would probably be split between
             - more experiments
             - and buying more time to spend with family and friends
     - Probably won't need to put a lot of effort into marketing and
       building an audience
         - Reasons to go out there
             - Can save other people time?
             - Can learn from other people?
             -
 - So this is what's going to happen for as long as I can do it.
     - I'm going to learn lots of things.
         - Curious
         - What people ask me about
         - From time to time, I may even dust off my outlines for future
           books
         - but I'd rather publish things bit by bit
         - Eventually I'll get good enough at writing from outlines (or
           slotting things back into them) that I can put together larger
           resources, like articles and books

*** Writing into the differences

 - What do I do differently?
     - Learning, writing, visual notetaking, sharing knowledge, and constant improvement
     - Planning, deciding, and tracking
     - Personal finance, semi-retirement, cooking, frugality, and household life
*** Stuff that works for me

 - Writing works better than interviews or speaking
     - Outlines, links
     - Even though I say a lot more words in an interview
     - Things I like about interviews
         - Other people's questions
         - Back and forth

*** Blogs and e-mail newsletters

 - conversation with Timothy Kenny, who has just started experimenting with daily e-mail newsletters
 - I suggested public archive

 - http://www.productiveflourishing.com/why-i-was-so-worked-up-about-killing-my-newsletter/#utm_source=feedly

 - I've been thinking about e-mail newsletters because Timothy Kenny
   has just started with his.
 - Typical advice for growing and (dare I say it?) monetizing your
   blog.
   - Offer an incentive for people to sign up for your mailing list.
     - PDF
     - exclusive content
   - Put people on an autoresponder.
   - Mail people regularly to build the relationship
     - Sell them stuff later on
 - I don't even send friends or family e-mail normally
   - Hmm, maybe I'm not used to the grammar of it?
 - also, it takes me an average of 6 minutes to reply to an e-mail.
   - Oddly,
 - RSS is mostly dead. Only geeky people use it. [[blog-subscribe][outline]]
 - Automatic e-mail newsletters
 - I want to sell things only if they save you a lot of time
 - Forget that. I want to give away so much that you almost feel
   obliged to help.
   - and since I don't need that much money for my lifestyle (I think)
 - I'm very good at planning inexpensive experiments. Besides, that
   makes it easier for other people to replicate.


 Why: because there are people who send e-mail, but don't blog

 - why don't they blog?
   - self-conscious: only the "best content" out there
 \

*** Blogging excuse-buster: I don't want to blog because I want to put my best foot forward

 This is something I hear a lot from people. "I don't want to blog
 because I might be embarrassed."

*** Thoughts on growing an audience
 - Sometimes I wonder if I should do more of the "Right Things" when
   it comes to building a blog.
     - Focus on one or two topics so that people will subscribe because
       you're consistent and reliable.
     - Research keywords so that you can optimize for search engines
       queries and write content that will bring people in.
     - Reach out to new audiences with guest posts.
     - Send e-mail newsletters so that you can build relationships and
       so that you can sell to people later on.
 - Why
     - Can save other people time
     - Can learn from more people
     - Scale up - create more value for each unit of time I invest
 - Sometimes I'm envious of blogs with hundreds of comments. On sites
   like that, people learn a lot from each other, not just me. But I
   remember that reading and responding to comments takes time, and I'd
   want to filter through them for spam, and that other people glaze
   over when they see pages and pages of comments and end up not
   reading them. It's okay. I like the in-depth conversations we have
   in comments. I'm not entirely sure if I'm sour-graping, but it seems
   to make sense.
 - Sometimes I wonder if this should be more like other blogs. But then
   that's a well-travelled path, with lots of other people exploring
   it. I have this amazing opportunity to try something different. I
   should.
 - Actually, I already know what I should do--what works for me, what
   I should do more.
     - The enduring posts on my blog are either tech notes (Emacs,
       Drupal) or sketches.
 - The clearer my "no", the less I'm distracted from the things that I
   can do.
 - Like the way I hack around my introversion
     - Write about whatever I'm learning about - variety of interests, and
       let more focused people use search results and category links
     - Look at other people's questions and failed search results to
       nudge me to write about certain topics if I'm curious about them
       too
     - Read good blogs and write about what inspires me, linking.
       Invite people who don't have blogs to share their tips and
       lessons learned on mine.
     - Build relationships through comments. Give away as much as I
       can of what I know. Let people show their appreciation if they
       want to. Money is nice, but there are other ways too.
 - Risks in getting too big
     - Internet has a seamy underside
 - Introvert
 - The time I would spend in pitching guest posts, etc.
     - versus making things

 - Drawing
     - Nearly 39,000 people visited in May, when I published
     - Plenty of blogs
     - Lots of infographics
     - Not that many useful, non-marketing drawings
 - It's okay

 - Are there low-effort, high-benefit things I can do to make this better?

     - Might get to the point where people are learning from each other
         - You can do this elsewhere on the Internet
         - So it would have to be a particularly interesting
           combination of people

 I miss teaching. I had tons of fun teaching computer science when I

 Stephanie Diamond suggested making a sketchnotes course on Udemy.
 People have asked me about teaching Emacs, or blogging, or Quantified
 Self tracking and analysis.

 - What would you value at $49?
 - What would you value at $99?

 At an applied rationality meetup in Toronto, the guest speaker
 confessed to being afraid of blogging because she didn't want to be

 leaves you no wiggle room.

 The resistance is a symptom that you're on the right track. /The
 resistance is not something to be avoided; it's something to seek
 out./ ... The artist sees out the feeling of the resistance and then
 tries to maximize it. The cog, the day laborer, the compliant
 student--they seek to eliminate the feeling instead.

   :END:

When people are starting out with sketchnoting, it's helpful to
remember that sketchnoting's about "ideas, not art" (as Mike Rohde
says in [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/12/visual-book-review-the-sketchnote-handbook-mike-rohde/][The Sketchnote Handbook]]). It's easy to get intimidated by the
visually-impressive sketchnotes people post, so the reminder is
useful.

I've been using sketchnotes to [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/12/year-drawing-own-content/][explore my own thoughts]] instead of
recording other people's content. I like flipping things around, so
that got me thinking: *What can I learn from the way artists work, and
how can I apply that to learning and drawing?*

Here are a few ideas:

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16021004097/][2015.01.05 What can I learn from artists about learning -- index card]]

- *Collect:* Artists collect inspiration. They fill sketchbooks, make
  moodboards, clip reference photos, and so on.
- *Emulate:* Artists develop their skills by emulating masters.
- *Observe:* Artists draw what's there, not what they think is there. They also analyze the techniques other artists use and the effect of these techniques on the piece.
- *Imagine:* Artists aren't limited to what they see. They can draw what _isn't_ there. They can draw the essence of a thing.
- *Transform:* Great art transforms the way people see.
- *Experiment:* Artists try different techniques and styles to figure out what works for them.
- *Craft:* Artists refine their work and improve their tools.
- *Sketch:* Artists do quick studies to try several views or focus on different aspects before making the commitment of paint on canvas.

I was particularly curious about this idea of making studies or
sketching things in order to experiment with different views or to
focus on small parts before composing the whole, so I dug into that
further.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16180954816/][2015.01.05 Why studies for drawing or writing thoughts -- index card]]

The limits I want to address are:
- When I start with a large sheet, I sometimes peter out halfway
  through because I've dug to the bottom of that idea (at least for
  now, with the tools and time I have).
- If I work with large sheets, it's not as easy to keep all the
  relevant ones in view at the same time. I need to summarize more
  frequently.
- I often zig-zag between topics, leaving sheets unfinished.
  Half-sheets are awkward to post.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16019468000/][2015.01.05 Quick idea studies -- index card]]

Using index cards for "studies" of an idea might be a useful
technique. Each card is a small chunk, quick to capture, complete in
itself, and yet linkable with others. The cards are easier to
rearrange. If each card represents one idea or summary, I can keep
more ideas in view.

There are trade-offs, naturally. Sometimes the desire to fill a large
sheet makes me to sit with a question longer, letting me discover
more. Large sheets gives me the ability to draw and describe
relationships between ideas. If I have many small chunks, I need to
invest more time in summarizing and filing in order to make the most
of them.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16206001482/][2015.01.05 Managing my idea pipeline -- index card]]

Artists might make studies in preparation for a specific work, or they
might make studies just because. If I have a specific question in
mind, it's easy to sketch my way around the topic and then organize
those thoughts into a whole. I'm not as good at managing fragments
over an extended period of time, although I'm getting better at
linking to and building on previous blog posts.

What can I learn from the way artists keep working on something?
Artists might work on a piece for weeks or more, keeping it visible on
an easel, taking a step back from time to time, looking at it in
different light. They might have several such pieces on the go. I
still prefer publishing early instead of waiting until something is a
masterpiece. Feedback is great, and even small chunks can be
surprisingly useful.

If I improve the way I manage my studies, though, I might get better
at refining ideas. I think it's like the way an artists might clip
photos or sketch things that have caught their eyes, and then return
to that inspiration years later when they think of something that
needs it.

Speaking of archives: I've written about index cards before as a way
to [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/09/index-cards/][develop thoughts]] (2014; much like this post), [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2007/05/charting-my-life-on-index-cards-saturday-afternoon-goal-setting-workshop/][plan my life]] (2007),
and [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2005/04/index-cards-for-today-boredom-prevention-device-contingency-plans-hipster-pda-taxi/][prevent boredom by writing]] (2005!). I haven't quite mastered this
yet, but I'm getting somewhere. What can I add to this based on this
reflection on artists?

I don't do enough zoomed-in focus or variations on a theme yet, I
think. Studies aren't just about capturing the gist of a thing so that
you can reproduce it later in your studio. They let you minutely
observe a specific aspect, and they let you experiment with different
ways to portray something.

What would that look like, if I could do it really well? For
observation, I might have index cards that focus on *sub-topics*, like the way I've built up this post from the
sub-questions in the illustrations. For variety, I might experiment
with *visual vocabulary and metaphors*, improving my creative
expression.

There's also something to be said about *sheer practice* in exploring
thoughts, like the way artists might sketch for sketching's sake.
James Altucher recommends coming up with [[http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/][ten ideas a day]] (also
related: [[http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/10/how-to-become-an-idea-machine/][his post from 2012]]). I've been experimenting with setting
myself a minimum of five index cards a day. I write the dates for all
of them before I start on the first one so that the desire to fill in
the blanks pushes me to complete all of them. This usually leads to
even more cards as the first set of ideas sparks more questions.

Actually, the challenge isn't generating ideas. Artists never run out
of things to sketch - they can look around and find more! I have an
archive of ideas I haven't exhausted and a cornucopia that generates
more every day.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16020717209/][2015.01.05 Thinking about my archive -- index card]]

This leads me back to skills that I think might be good to borrow from
the art world and adapt to what I want:
- *Observing what's in front of me* - really seeing it, capturing it
  better, evoking its essence
- *Looking at something from different angles*, and developing opinions
  about the alternatives I can pick - like the way artists learn about
  composition and light
- *Retrieving subsets of my archive* - like the way artists might pull
  out the relevant studies or reference photos when they're working on
  a piece
- *Comprehending the whole* - the way people can step back and talk
  about impressionism, Picasso's Blue Period, and other things that
  require zooming out

What would masters of this be like, and how can I emulate them? I
think of [[https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1920&bih=1085&q=leonardo+da+vinci+studies&oq=leonardo+da+vinci+studies&gs_l=img.3..0l2.1662.4950.0.5169.28.14.1.6.6.0.195.1544.2j9.11.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.60.img..10.18.1640.U0gilXXy2GQ][Leonardo da Vinci's studies]], asking and observing. I think of
writers who name and describe things, and in so doing, they help me
see better - the way the light behind an object separates it from the
background. I may never draw or write a thousandth as well as they do,
but I can grow through emulating the way they slow down and pay
attention, the way they turn things over and over instead of rushing
on.

** Visual notetaking
*** Another year of drawing thoughts

In 2013, I decided to focus on [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/12/year-drawing-own-content/][drawing my own content instead of
sketchnoting other people's talks]]. I drew 379 sketches exploring my
questions, and I wove those into my blog posts so that I could think
in bigger chunks.

In 2014, I continued this habit.

  - Tracking? Table instead of deleting, maybe integrating with my writing outline. thinking outline?
  - Ooh. I like that. An outline is similar to a regular map, actually (zooming in and out). Plus hyperlinks?
    - More than flat categories

      - TODO: ___ (here there be dragons)
    - Keeping track of sketches = ability to "zoom in"?
  - and also the relationship between sketches and ideas

*** TODO Running the numbers on my sketches

*** DRAFTED How to get started with sketchnoting  :one-pager:
Draw this

1. Take notes
- Why

2. Take hand-written notes

3. Slow down and write legibly
   You don't have to write everything
   Leave yourself space, then come back and fill things in later
   A good ink helps: find one that's readable and doesn't smear
   Tip: stash pens everywhere so that you're never without one!

4. Emphasize important concepts
   Boxes, highlighter, color pencils, etc
   (Test the highlighter - sometimes ink can get messed up!)

5. Use simple shapes.
   Star - important point
   Box, check - TODO
   Arrow - next step
   Speech bubble - quote
   Thought cloud - what you were thinking
   Lightbulb - idea

   Make rough copies of diagrams

6. Have fun by drawing faces. This is a surprisingly good way to
   remember an event, and it's also a good way to settle in if you're
   early. (Being early is great for grabbing good seats.)

   Write down the topic title and the speaker name, then spend a few
   minutes sketching the person's face. You can start with a simple
   rectangle with roughly the right proportions. Hair style? Glasses
   or eyes? Nose? Facial hair? Smile? Doesn't have to be perfect.

7. Draw other icons. People often repeat themselves or say things you
   don't have to write down, so you can doodle during those parts.
   Draw simple images related to what people are talking about. (Or
   draw things that are completely unrelated - up to you!) Listen for
   visual metaphors and try to draw them. Leave yourself space, and
   then come back and doodle when you have time.

I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.

Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a

I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.

Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder...

How to listen and draw at the same time


When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!

When I took the required philosophy courses in university, I was too
young for it. We all were; inarticulate adolescents with little life
experience. Perhaps a brilliant teacher would have been able to teach
it anyway, and perhaps for some of my classmates our teachers were
brilliant. I struggled with the courses, though. The topics seemed
abstract and impractical. We read Plato's /Republic/ and were quizzed
on his ideal society. We read the /Nichomachean Ethics/ and
differentiated among types of friendship. We read Hannah Arendt's
thoughts on totalitarianism and discussed terror. But nothing really
made an impact on my everyday life, aside from the unexpected oddness
of being comfortable with--even enjoying--the hopelessness and despair
described by Sartre when it seemed, based on how we were taught and
how my classmates responded, that I should have had more philosophical
discomfort with the concept.

#+begin_quote
Hence the young man is not a fit student of Moral Philosophy, for he
has no experience in the actions of life, while all that is said
presupposes and is concerned with these: and in the next place, since
he is apt to follow the impulses of his passions, he will hear as
though he heard not, and to no profit, the end in view being practice
and not mere knowledge.
#+end_quote
Aristotle, /Nichomachean Ethics/ (Book 1 - 1095a)

The normal course of events, perhaps, might be that I'd revisit these
topics later in life. Much later, the way people conscious of
mortality tend to think about life. I think this 5-year experiment of
mine nudged me to think about the best use of time, and from there to
wonder about Aristotle's recommendation of the contemplative life.
Time and patience

I'm not quite at the point of understanding Heidegger and similar
thinkers. I don't need to get there, I think, in order to get some
benefit from applying philosophy to life. I want to train my mind to
see clearly, want the right things, not want the wrong things, act on
these right judgments, and be able to explain what I'm learning to
myself and to others. Starting this early makes sense, because then I
can avoid bad habits (or unlearn them before they get ingrained) and
enjoy the benefits for longer.

#+begin_quote
Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you
may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace
with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when
you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but
quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when
one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.
#+end_quote
Seneca, /Epistles/, Letter 4

In a later letter, Seneca also tells us that we don't have to put this
kind of thinking off until we are comfortably settled. This reminds me
of how people set these constantly moving goalposts for themselves ("I
just need to make $XXX,000" - and then higher, and higher), and why it
made sense to me to risk jumping earlier rather than later. We'll see
how this works out.

#+begin_quote
Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and
living simply is voluntary poverty. Away, then, with all excuses like:
"I have not yet enough; when I have gained the desired amount, then I
shall devote myself wholly to philosophy." And yet this ideal, which
you are putting off and placing second to other interests, should be
secured first of all; you should begin with it. You retort: "I wish to
acquire something to live on." Yes, but learn while you are acquiring
it; for if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to
die nobly.
#+end_quote
Seneca, /Epistles/, Letter 17

Now is a good time, I think. I can train my thinking and inspire my
writing with classic, clear texts, and I can work on learning things
that are common to more people than my other niche interests are.

In /Nichomachean Ethics/, Aristotle considers virtue as the ideal balance between two vices (one type of deficiency and one of excess). For example, courage is between cowardice and foolhardiness. This is the idea of the golden mean. Virtue is a little closer to one end than the other, so we should err on the side of the lesser evil. We also naturally skew to one side, so we should try to counteract our biases.

#+begin_quote
Therefore he who aims at the mean should make it his first care to keep away from that extreme which is more contrary than the other to the mean; just as Calypso in Homer advises Ulysses,

"Clear of this smoke and surge thy barque direct;"

because of the two extremes the one is always more, and the other less, erroneous; and, therefore, since to hit exactly on the mean is difficult, one must take the least of the evils as the safest plan; and this a man will be doing, if he follows this method.
#+end_quote
(from D.P. Chase's translation)

and

#+begin_quote
We ought also to take into consideration our own natural bias; which varies in each man's case, and will be ascertained from the pleasure and pain arising in us. Furthermore, we should force ourselves off in the contrary direction, because we shall find ourselves in the mean after we have removed ourselves far from the wrong side, exactly as men do in straightening bent timber.
#+end_quote
(also D.P. Chase)

Of the ranges he describes, I think I lean towards:

- *cowardice*, COURAGE, recklessness
- *stinginess*, LIBERALITY, prodigality
- *parsimony*, MAGNIFICENCE, vulgarity and crassness
- *unirasciblility/slavishness*, GENTLENESS, irascibility

These vices of mine are a set. Despite knowing that people tend to
regret inaction more than action and that in the grand scheme of
things, there is nothing to fear, I make decisions carefully and anticipate more pain than I should. Still, I'm pretty good at hope.
I prefer to save money so that I can maintain my freedom. I give a
little to charities and to people when it could make a big difference.
I tend to think that people usually benefit more from time and
attention more than money, so I rarely have clear decisions between
noble action and money. I'm definitely not good at using large sums for worthy work, and more habituated towards accounting for the small things.
I keep myself a little distant from the world, minimizing anger. There are many things that perhaps I should be angrier at, but I prefer to move on.

- insensibility, MODERATION, licentiousness
- irony/understatement, PLAIN DEALING, boastfulness

I am generally good at not being pained by the absence of pleasures and not taking more pleasure in things than they're worth. Possibly I err on the side of insensibility, since I don't get as much pleasure from things that I probably should appreciate better. I also tend to be good at disclaiming my limitations instead of pretending to be better than I am.

- boorishness, WITTINESS, buffoonery

I enjoy wordplay. Still, I don't recognize myself in Aristotle's
descriptions here. I guess it's just not developed enough to be a
virtue (even a virtue-in-training?) and not extreme enough to be a
vice.

- quarrelsomeness, FRIENDLINESS, *obsequity*

I skew towards finding things and people agreeable (or at least
letting them make their own decisions). I probably don't challenge
people enough, not the way a good friend would call you out if you're
doing things wrong.

With that in mind, how can I improve? It's pretty difficult to take
Aristotle's suggestion for counteract my biases by aiming for the
opposite vice. Examples of consequences are too easy to recall. The
Internet is full of stories of recklesness, prodigality, crassness,
irascibility, licentiousness, and buffoonery. No one enjoys
quarrelsomeness. Irony/understatement recedes into the background.

There are some other ways that have been working for me, though. Maybe
building on these approaches will help me do even better. Aristotle
says that you can develop virtue by practising virtuous acts, so maybe
there's hope for me yet. Here are some workarounds for my biases:

- *Towards courage, liberality, and magnificence - setting aside money and time beforehand:* Pre-allocating a small
  portion of my savings for trying things out helps me reduce the
  mental cost of choices. Setting aside a small charity budget (both
  time and money) makes it easier to say, yes, this is something I can
  help with. I don't have to limit myself to formal channels for
  generosity, either. Even listening, cleaning, or cooking can be acts
  of generosity, done with the right heart.
- *Towards courage - Keeping learning in mind:* If I'm conservative about choices
  because I don't want to mess up really badly, remembering that I can
  learn even from messing up may help. Besides, I can practice on
  choices with smaller consequences, and I can remember all those
  times when making similar choices worked out okay.
- *Approaching life with the question "How wonderful can it be?" *:
  I'm reluctant to be too ambitious because I've seen so many stories
  of people who get carried away by their passions, dealing with the
  ups and downs of having a business or following their goals. I'm not
  keen on having that kind of narrative. However, if I start with a
  good foundation of happiness and then constantly expand by learning
  more, doing more, and helping more, I think I can enfold larger and
  larger things in my ambition without taking the other kind of greed
  or desire into me.
- *Learning about the little differences*: Knowledge sharpens
  appreciation. A tiny example - I now have a preference for the
  blueberries we grow (however scant the handful) over the blueberries
  we buy at No Frills because I know that blueberries can be tastier
  than what we get at the supermarket. This doesn't stop me from
  appreciating blueberry muffins made with supermarket berries, but it
  allows me to take greater pleasure when we do have berries at home.
  Likewise, learning about the little distinctions can help me enjoy
  other things better, and I can be careful about not turning into a
  snob who can't enjoy simpler things.
- *Focusing on the good*:

- humility, MODESTY, *pride*
- secrecy, HONESTY, *loquacity*
- moroseness, GOOD HUMOR, *absurdity*
- quarrelsomeness, FRIENDSHIP, *flattery*


We've been trying

and we occasionally succeed, but more often than not, we end up going for a yummy home-cooked dinner instead.

*** CANCELLED Reflections on a philosophy of life			:reflection:philosophy:
		 CLOSED: [2014-09-14 Sun 20:18]

I remember struggling with the required philosophy classes in
university. Some concepts came easily. Others remained abstract. My
teachers were generally animated and good educators, but lectures tend
to lull me into sleep. Fortunately, 19-year-old me had a laptop,
tolerant teachers, the work-around of transcribing as much as she
could before trailing off into unintelligibility.

[[http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/11/coming-up-with-a-three-word-life-philosophy/]["Learn, share, scale"]] were the three words I picked in 2012 to
describe what I want to do. It's a useful framework for looking at my
different interests and figuring out how I can learn, what I can
share, and how I can scale up beyond the limits of 24 hours in a day
and only one life. By breaking things down into those components, I
can look for more effective approaches. By seeing them as a whole
cycle, I can try to move more through each stage instead of getting
stuck in one or the other.

I've been learning about philosophy over the past few weeks. I like
the way Thoreau frames it:

#+begin_quote

So I'm more interested in ethical philosophy rather than, say, phenomenology.



What would that look like in this framework of "learn, share, scale?"

*Learn*: I read a lot of books

*Share*: i

*Scale*: This one's a little harder to think about.

We've been watching episodes of [[https://www.youtube.com/user/HISHEdotcom][How It Should Have Ended]] lately. One
of them led to Stan's Rants, so we watched Stan Lee rant about a few
things. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXl0g6LxGyc][His rant about birthdays]] was particularly interesting for me
because of our reflections on Stoicism, negative visualization, and
the idea of /memento mori/ - remembering your mortality.

W- and I don't celebrate the way it seems other people do. We're not
really into going to a bar with friends, having people over for a
party, or going to a fancy restaurant. We did end up going for dimsum
with his family yesterday, since his mom insisted, but otherwise we
would have probably stayed home.

I like treating these occasions as an opportunity to account for how I
used the previous year, reflect on (and celebrate!) the changes, and
think about how my priorities might shift for the upcoming year. Doing
this kind of annual review around this time makes more sense to me
than New Year's Day, since New Year's Day has all that noise around
holidays and resolutions. I used to do annual reviews a few times a
year, but I found myself covering the same ground and getting slightly
confused about the timespans. I do like checking in with myself on an
infrequent basis, though. You might not see day-to-day changes, but
when you look back over a longer period of time, you can appreciate
the distance you've covered.

Still, there's something to be said about celebrating milestones,
creating opportunities for shared experiences, and thanking people who
are part of my life. Perhaps I'll revisit it sometime, or find a
different way.

But I'll still wish my parents a happy birthday, since after all, my mom did all that hard work. =)

There's something about taking a look at processes that intimidate you
and seeing if you can break them down into smaller steps that are more
manageable. I've been thinking about shifting some of my investments
from TD e-series index funds to exchange traded funds (ETFs), since
that seems to be the next step in my personal finance journey. I've
held back from making that decision, though. On one hand, it only
makes sense if you commit a large amount. On the other hand, it's a
little scary to experiment with an amount large enough to make a
difference.

My investing story has been all about baby steps. I started with TD
e-series funds soon after receiving my first paycheque in 2007. I
chose those index funds because of their low management expense ratios
(MERs). I invested as much as I could, ignoring the doom-and-gloom
of 2008. If I'd carved out more of my budget, I could have taken more
advantage of the recovery. But in retrospect, I probably would have
made the same decisions; most of my savings went into building an
emergency fund and an opportunity fund, and that was important for
making me feel safer and encouraging me to take small risks. As I
built a good safety net, I invested more.

This has been going well so far. I've settled into a rhythm of
rebalancing by way of annual contributions. I think I've reached the
point at which it makes sense to switch to ETFs, since those have even
lower MERs. Most forum posts I've read about ETFs focus on discount
brokers like Questrade because of their free or low-cost trades, but
I'm hesitant about switching to Questrade because of the customer
service complaints I've read. I know that's slightly irrational,
biased by salience; the horror stories stick in my head, even though I
know lots of people are happy with it and I have the persistence to
deal with technical issues.

Maybe I can dip my toes into the ETF waters by converting the Canadian
index fund investments I have in my RRSP into something like VCN, but
within TD Waterhouse instead of creating an account with Questrade.
This means that I'll need to spend $10 each time I buy shares instead
of buying them for free, but since I'm planning to hold these for a
very long time and I rebalance yearly, the difference in transaction
costs is likely to be worth it if it gets me to act.

It looks like putting in a limit order is the best way to do this, so
I'll take care of that once the money from the sale of my e-series
fund arrives in my investment account.

The difference between the MERs for the TD Canadian Index e-series
fund (0.33%) and VCN (0.10%) isn't much for the amount I'm looking at
experimenting with, but it's more about getting over the intimidation
factor of trying out ETFs. If I try it and it works out, I might try
converting some of my non-registered investments when the capital
gains make sense (either a low-income year or one of the inevitable
slumps in the market). Alternatively, I might try the popular approach
of accumulating investments in an e-series fund (maybe the TFSA,
especially if they increase the contribution room) and then
periodically converting that into ETFs.

I'm cautiously optimistic about how the stock market will perform over
the next few decades. Its recent gains don't quite seem connected with
the struggles of jobseekers and small business owners around me, and
there's some kerfluffle over oil prices that I don't quite understand.
But I'm less concerned now than I used to be about demographic-related
stock market crashes (someone pointed out that many people don't have
that much invested in the stock market anyway), and sufficient savings
can help me ride out a 2008-style downturn. We don't seem to be headed
towards decades-long malaise. Even if we do end up with market
difficulties, chances are I'll be right in the same bucket with
everyone else, so it's no big loss.

I'm still nowhere near ready to pick individual stocks, much less
day-trade. Neither my self-confidence or my ambitions are strong
enough to tempt me to that path.

More than that, investing in frugal choices and skills gives me more
independence. The more I can cook healthy, yummy meals with low-cost
ingredients, the less I depend on finances. The more I can improve or
entertain myself with free or low-cost resources, the richer life I
live. As I build online and offline relationships with people who
share similar values, my world grows.

The difference between the management expense ratios of TD e-series
funds and index ETFs probably isn't going to result in a significant
difference in my investment results. Not as significant as the
decision to keep investing, or the choice of a particular lifestyle.
But as practice in breaking down and trying out intimidating things,
I think it will be worthwhile.

*** Eating out and eating in

W- and I have been taking advantage of the summer weather by biking around the city during weekends. We're working on being more adventurous, and have so far discovered a Japanese curry place that we like. What tends to happen, though, is that we end up talking ourselves out of going out to eat (expensive; can be less healthy; besides, it's all the same at the end)


*** Working on ignoring thresholds

Isn't it funny how we end up being pulled by round numbers and thresholds?

I calculate my net worth every month, and sometimes more often out of
curiosity. It goes up and down with the markets. This is gratifying
when it's going up (look! I didn't have to do anything special for
that!). Oddly, it's still reassuring even when it goes down, since I'm
not drawing down the money yet. I don't really change my decisions based on this information. I'm just curious about the growth.

Still, I've been checking my finances more recently because my 31st birthday is coming up, and I'm /this close/ to reaching one of those arbitrary savings thresholds.

*** CANCELLED Building an opportunity fund
		 CLOSED: [2014-09-14 Sun 20:18]

Sometimes I hear from people who are stuck. They want to try something
that could result in more earnings, but they don't have the time to do
so because they need to focus on paid work. For freelancers, this bind
can be particularly tight if you don't have good savings or you've
exhausted your resources.

If you have savings, it's easier to take risks and try things out.
You're less worried about messing things up. If you have savings that
are dedicated for exploring opportunities in addition to a general
emergency fund, it's even easier to experiment. It's a good idea to
set aside a portion of your income for an *opportunity fund*. You can
use your opportunity fund to pay for tools, education, coaching,
services, or other time-savers. You can also use it as a safety net
when you want to spend more time and energy on your personal projects.
False starts hurt less, so you can try more. You become a capitalist,
an entrepreneur, examining the opportunities and deciding where to
deploy your money. You work on getting the best return, because you
want to feed those profits back into your opportunity fund.

I'm a natural saver, so it was easy for me to keep my wants simple and
set aside a small percentage of my income for an opportunity fund. I
remember being excited about watching the balance grow. One time, I
used my opportunity fund to buy a Nintendo DS partly for entertainment
and partly for drawing. I used that to draw my presentations, which
resulted in invitations to conferences, connections with mentors, and
a boost to my career. I took the results and confidence from that and
saved up for a professional drawing tablet, which I used to put
together something that won a competition. That success encouraged me
to take the next step of getting a tablet PC, which led me to
sketchnoting, which led to even more opportunities. Small investments
compound. I've used the opportunity fund for things that didn't work
out as well as I hoped, too, but since I limit myself to small bets
before making bigger ones, things have been okay.

But what if you don't have those savings yet?

*Frugality* can help you widen the gap between your income and your
expenses so that you can keep more money and build up your savings.
The more savings you have, the easier it is to save. For example, if
you live on the edge, it's hard to wait for sales or buy in bulk. If
you have a little more capital, though, you can take advantage of the
occasional sale on essential items, and equip yourself with the tools
and skills you need to make the most of them. Aside from finding more
cost-effective ways to do things, you might take a look at your
expenses and trim things that you'd been paying out of inattention or
limit the luxuries you enjoy. Frugality might not make you that much
richer, but it can give you breathing room.

*Widen your work options.* If your freelancing income is unpredictable
and this is wreaking havoc on your finances, consider taking a stabler
job (even if it's less exciting). Build up your savings and work on
your passion projects in your off hours. Then, when you've got the
safety net you need in order to do well, make the jump again. Many
people rule out certain types of jobs as beneath them, but if you
shift your perspective, you might be able to make it work for you.

*Learn to sell.* Let's say that you want to keep freelancing and
working on your own projects because you're worried that you might
forget your dreams if you're distracted by a regular job. Learn to
sell, then. Find out how to communicate more value so that you can
earn more. See if you can break your project down into smaller parts
and sell those. Instead of waiting until you find the time to finish
an entire book, try to publish shorter guides and resources. If
there's a project you really want to work on but you can't carve out
enough time to work on it, see if you can pre-sell the idea to people
who might find it useful and who are willing to contribute to its
development.

I think the best thing of all is to build yourself that safety net--
usually a combination of savings and a frugal lifestyle--so that you
can

Want that freedom more than you want a moment's entertainment,
convenient food, or other comforts.

One of the downsides of building a really good frugality muscle (that reflexive reaction of "Oh, I don't really need this, do I?") is that

I’ve been reading through Mr. Money Mustache’s blog archive, and his blog post on What would you do with WAY MORE money? made me think about what I value and what I would change. Like him, I’m comfortable with the way things are. I like eating at home. I like getting books and movies from the library instead of buying them. (No storage or waste issues, wide selection, and the satisfaction of boosting library circulation statistics…) I like my hobbies and interests. I like my freedom from the endless hedonic treadmill.
Not even the latest apps or gadgets, aside from the occasional experiment. (Shh! I hope they don’t take away my geek card. ;) )
About the only thing that would be awesomer would be to make more frequent trips to the Philippines (maybe every year! or on a whim!) or to join family and friends on their vacations. Although that’s constrained by other things too, like the fact that I like spending time with W- and he needs to be here in Toronto for J-.

It’s finally spring in full force, and I’ve been biking whenever I can get away with it. The bike ride is a little faster than the subway commute to my client, and I like not have to squeeze into the crowded train. Free exercise along a well-maintained trail with plenty of flowers and trees…

*** Substituting pleasures
It’s been easier and easier to substitute pleasures. A $12 bowl of pho is yummy, but a $2 banh mi sandwich will do just fine. Why buy a DVD (even a used one) if there are so many unwatched ones at the library? I have clothes I haven’t worn in ages.
*** Managing my personal and business finances
*** Time and gadget tradeoffs
*** What's worth spending on?
I'd been contemplating this question for the past four years.

What's worth spending on? I invest for the future, save for unexpected expenses, and support causes and people - but it's good to have that discretionary part of my budget which I can use to enjoy life and learn how to make better decisions.

Many people care about stuff. I apporeciate that. There are many examples of things that have enabled me to enjoy and learn from life so much more, such as my tablet PC.

Many people care about experiences. I appreciate that, too. I like how experiences can lead to deeper relationships.

Many people know something else that I'm just beginning to figure out. You can spend on people, on time, on making things happen. This is awesome! There's a candy store of talent out there - a world full of people with unique experiences, skills, and passions.

Like the way I've learned about what works well for me in terms of
spending on stuff and experiences, I want to learn how to spend on
making things happen. And who knows? If I can get good enough at it,
maybe I can learn how to create so much value that it becomes a
self-perpetuating machine.

This year, I am going to become the sort of person who exercises
regularly. I'm not particularly concerned about reaching a certain
weight, but I'd like to improve my strength and endurance. W- is
helping me ease into the learn-to-run program he did at work. I'm also
starting from the first rung on the [[https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/exercise.html][fitness ladder]] from The Hacker's
Diet. Small activities like these don't take a lot of time, and the
gradual progression will help me build confidence.

I'd also like to turn more exercise activities into ones that W- and I
can share. Krav maga isn't my cup of tea, but I think I'll like
jogging and walking with W-. We can stretch or do some weight-training
while watching videos. Biking is fun, too.

What does making fitness part of me mean? I think it means being in
tune with how things work, paying attention to the details and the
changes. It's probably like the way [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/06/garden-becoming-part-daily-life/][daily gardening]] has changed my
experience of the backyard compared to when I dabbled in it. I'm
looking forward to trying more things and learning more.

Identity is a big factor when it comes to maintaining good habits.
When you make something part of who you are, it's easier to keep doing
it, and it's harder to neglect it. Here are some of the other identity
changes I've gone through:

- I changed from someone who takes transit all the time to someone who
  bikes whenever she can.
- I changed from someone who hated writing for school to someone who
  enjoys writing for this blog.
- I changed from someone who grew up around household staff (cook,
  maids) to someone who cooks practically all her meals and takes care
  of her own chores.

I have the time, space, and support I need, and it's good for me. I
can see the results of good habits and the consequences of poor ones.
And I'm going to do it without gym memberships or other things like
that. We already have all the tools I need, so I just have to do it. =)

Having resolved to [[http://sachachua.com/blog/?p=27760&shareadraft=baba27760_54aaee206a1d6][learn how to work on my own things]], I'm
experimenting with reducing my consulting to one day a week (from last
year's routine of two days a week). I spend most of the week reading,
drawing, writing, experimenting, and coding.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16212510046/][2015.01.09 What do I do on my non-consulting days -- index card]]

It's not a big change in terms of hours. I already have plenty of time
for personal projects. But I feel the shift in the balance. I can hear
that inner self-doubt saying, "Is this real work? Is it worthwhile? Is
it sustainable? Are you undermining your safety by goofing off?"

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16035565538/][2015.01.07 Real Work -- index card]]

It's okay. I expected this resistance, this anxiety. It's just one of
those mental barriers I have to break. Fortunately, all those Stoic
philosophers are there to remind me that it's just a negative
impression, not reality, and the truth is that I have nothing to fear.

I'm getting better at telling that anxious part of my mind: "Look.
Even though I offer all those resources for free, people willingly pay
for it. And other people write wonderful comments and send me e-mail
telling me that I've inspired them to learn more and that they want to
help, so that counts too. Yeah, there's a chance I might need to go
back to Regular Work if the stock market crashes or a catastrophe
happens, but in the meantime, just give this a chance. And really,
that scenario isn't the end of the world. Other people do okay. I can
too. Besides, that's why we have safety nets, right?"

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16028683309/][2015.01.06 Planning my safety nets -- index card]]
[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16212902321/][2015.01.06 Safe, a little better, comfortable -- index card]]

And then my anxious side goes, "Okay, you've probably got the basics
covered. But what if your expenses grow, or W- gets tired of living
frugally and wants to upgrade lifestyles a little bit?"

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16036967069/][2015.01.06 Is this enough for me -- index card]]

And then I say, "We'll probably have some time to adjust our plans for
that, and I can always go back to doing Real Work that satisfies you.
Besides, if we want to upgrade our life experiences, learning the
skills to make stuff for ourselves often works out better than buying
things. Like cooking!"

(It's true! It's even called the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect][IKEA effect]].)

Then my anxious side goes, "Fine. Maybe you have enough space to
experiment right now. You want to learn things and help people. But
look at your blog! It's so self-centred. You talk about your questions
and reflections, and you rarely give people tips they can directly
apply to their lives."

Then I say, "I'll get better at writing for other people. In the
meantime, this seems to be working okay so far. People translate my
reflections into stuff that they can use."

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15586970103/][2015.01.04 What kind of difference do I want to make, and for whom --
index card]]

Here's how I think my blog helps other people at the moment. Maybe you
come across my blog because of a search. You find something that saves
you a little time. You browse around a little and learn about things
you didn't even think about searching for. Maybe you come back once in
a while for more of those ideas. You bump into other topics you're
curious about, and you explore. You might [[http://sachachua.com/blog/subscribe/][subscribe]], even though you
know I post practically every day. You skim the headlines for things
that interest you, and you dive into stuff you like. Sometimes you
might even feel moved to comment, e-mail, invest time, or even send
some money.

My anxious side grumbles, "Okay. I'm not sure your blog counts as Real
Work, but I'll grant that people seem to find /some/ value in it. I'd
feel better if you were more serious about building a business around
it - if you could cover more of your expenses with this instead of
consulting income or dividends."

To which I say, "You know, I'm not sure any amount of money would get
you to the point of not worrying. Besides, it's good that you worry,
because that helps keep us safe. This stream will grow as I figure out
how to make things that are truly valuable to people. I bet you I can
pull it off while still keeping the free/pay-what-you-want aspect,
because that's important to me. Given that you tend to squirrel away
additional money to build up safety instead of getting better at
investing it to build up capabilities, what we really should be
thinking about is if we can make better exchanges of *time* instead of
money. That will probably make a bigger difference anyway."

My anxious side is sufficiently boggled by that idea and can't come
up with a good rejoinder. This is promising. Let me dig into it further, then.

One of the concepts I picked up from /Your Money or Your Life/
(Dominguez and Robin, 1999) is that you can think of money in terms of
the time it took you to earn it, a sobering thought when you apply it
to your expenses.

I can apply that idea to other people, too; if other people pay money
for something I made, it represents the chunk of their life that they
spent earning it (and the opportunity cost of anything else they
could've bought or invested in, including saving up for their own
freedom).

I'm frugal (bordering on being a cheapskate), having gotten very good
at making the most of inexpensive resources. Because of the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy][typical
mind fallacy]], I tend to think that other people should be frugal as
well so that they can save up for their own freedom. I suspect that
people might get marginally more value from saving that money than I
would get from them giving it to me, since their stress reduction or
freedom expansion will likely outweigh my slightly increased feeling
of safety. On the other hand, people do get value from feeling
generous and from patronizing something that they would like to see
flourish, so I can agree with that.

If we translate it back to time, though, I'm more comfortable with the
exchange.

I already have enough time for the priorities in my life, while many
people feel that they don't have enough time for the priorities in
theirs. Adding more money to my life doesn't easily translate into
additional or more effective time (aside from transcripts and tools,
which I already budget for), while translating that money back into
time might make more of a difference in other people's lives. So a
direct swap doesn't make sense.

However, if we can exchange time in an apples-and-oranges sort of way,
that might make sense. That is, if someone gives me 15 minutes of
their time that translates to much more than 15 minutes of my time or
might even be something I could not do on my own, that would be
fantastic. This could be something that takes advantage of someone's:
- experience or particular mix of interests
- ideas, knowledge
- perspective (writing, coding, and all sorts of things can be
  improved with the perspective of someone *who is not me*)
- questions
- connections

Technically, delegation is supposed to help me translate money into
time that is qualitatively different from my time, but my anxious side
has not been very good at evaluating, trusting, or making the most of
learning from people who know different things than I do.

Figuring out a way to *effectively receive other people's gifts of time* might be what I need to break through this barrier.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16180954226/][2015.01.04 Thinking in terms of an exchange of time -- index card]]

*In fact, receiving time might be more effective than receiving
money.* Not only could that get around my difficulty with finding and
paying other people for the qualitatively different time that I want,
but if we structure it right, people will *gain* from the time that
they give. If someone asks me a good question that prompts me to
learn, reflect on, or share something, we both gain. If they invest
more time into experimenting with the ideas, we gain even more. I
can't actually *buy* that on any of the freelancing or outsourcing
marketplaces. There's no way for me to convert money into that kind of
experience.

So, how can people can give me 15 minutes of time in a way that helps
them and helps me? Let me think about different things I'm learning about:

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16052554827/][2015.01.09 Time is greater than money -- index card]]

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16212510076/][2015.01.09 What am I learning more about, and how can people help -- index card]]

It makes sense to organize this by interest instead of by action.

- *Emacs:* Ask a question, pass along a tip, share a workflow. Also, I
  really appreciate people showing up at Emacs Hangouts or being on
  Emacs Chats, because my anxious side is always firmly convinced that
  this will be the day when no one else shows up to a party or that
  conversation will be super-awkward.

- *Coding in general:* There are *so* many ways I want to improve in
  order to become a better programmer. I should set up continuous
  integration, write more tests, refactor my code, learn more
  frameworks and learn them more deeply, write more idiomatic code,
  improve performance and security, get better at designing... I find
  it difficult to pay someone to give me feedback and coach me through
  setting things up well (hard to evaluate people, anxious side balks
  at the price and argues we can figure things out on our own, good
  programmers have high rates), but this might be something we can
  swap. Or I could work on overriding my anxious side and just Go For
  It, because good habits and infrastructure pay off.

- *Writing:* Comments, questions, and links help a lot. A few of my
  posts have really benefited from people's feedback on the content
  and the structure of ideas, and I'd love to learn from more
  conversations like that. I don't worry a lot about typos or minor
  tweaks, so the kind of editing feedback I can easily get from
  freelancers doesn't satisfy me. I want to get better at writing for
  other people and organizing more complex thoughts into resources, so
  I could benefit a lot from feedback, questions, as well as advice on
  what to learn and in what order.

- *Drawing:* I'm not focused on drawing better (I can probably get
  away with stick figures for what I want to do!), but rather on being
  able to think more interesting thoughts. What would help with this?
  Hearing from people about which thoughts spark ideas in them, which
  ones I should flesh out further. Book recommendations and shared
  experiences would help too.

So: Paying for free/pay-what-you-want-resources is great at helping me
tell my anxious side, "Look, people find this valuable," and that's
*much* appreciated. But giving me time works too. If we can figure out
how to do this well, that might be able to help me grow more (at least
until I sort out a way to talk my anxious side into letting me invest
more in capabilities). Shifting the balance towards time is probably
going to make my anxious side *more* anxious, but I might be able to
tell it to give me a year or two to experiment, which is
coincidentally the rest of this 5-year span.

Wild success might look like:
- Thanks to people's gifts of time and attention, I'm learning and
  doing stuff that I couldn't do on my own or with the resources I
  could get in marketplaces
- Thanks to people's gifts of money (and maybe teaching), I've
  addressed more of my anxious side's concerns and am getting better
  at experimenting with the resources I /can/ get in marketplaces
- I can incorporate people's feedback and revealed preferences in my
  prioritization so that I work on things that other people find
  valuable

I could use your help with this. =) Shall we figure it out together?

Following up on an interview, a journalist asked:

#+begin_quote
If I were to say that you freelance as [blank] consultant, what would be the word that fills that blank?
#+end_quote

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16091691968/][2015-01-14 Filling in the occupational blanks -- index card #experiment #occupation]]

Tricky question. "Freelance" is definitely the wrong word for it,
since I doubt I'll be taking on any more clients and the word obscures
my current fascination with a self-directed life. It might make sense
to use the word "independent" if we really need to contrast this with
stable employment.

Technically, I spend a fraction of my time consulting, and I can
define the kind of consulting that I do in a compact phrase. But based
on my [[http://quantifiedawesome.com/time/review?utf8=%E2%9C%93&start=2014-01-01&end=2015-01-01&parent_id=&category_tree=full&display_type=percentage&zoom_level=&commit=Filter][2014 numbers]], that's only 12% of my time. This is much less than
the 37% of the time I spend sleeping, or even the 18% of the time I
spend on discretionary projects or the 15% of the time I spend taking
care of myself (not including the 7% of the time I spend on chores,
errands, and other things).

Since no one gets introduced as a sleeper even though that's what we
mostly do with our lives, maybe my discretionary projects will yield a
neat occupational description for people who /need/ to have that
introductory phrase.

- Am I a writer (3%)? ("Author" is a smidge more self-directed and
  respectable, maybe, but I still don't feel like I've written Real
  Books since all my resources are compilations of blog posts). A
  blogger? This is a category so large, it could mean anything.
- A sketchnoter (3%)? Alternatively: a sketchnote artist or a doodler,
  depending on whether I'm making it sound more respectable or more
  approachable. But the popular understanding of sketchnotes (if there
  is one) is that of recording other people's thoughts, and I'm
  focusing on exploring my own questions.
- An Emacs geek (2%)? Too obscure; it doesn't provide useful
  information for most people. Maybe an open source developer, which
  also includes the 1% of the time I spend coding -- but I do more
  writing *about* software than writing actual software or
  contributing to projects. An open source advocate? But I don't push
  it on people or try to change people's minds.

In the rare meetups I go to, I usually mention a bunch of my interests
(drawing, writing, coding, experimenting), and people pick whatever
they're curious about. But most times, I try to preempt the "What do
*you* do?" question with something more interesting for me, like what
people are learning about or interested in. It's so much easier when
someone recognizes me from my blog, because then we can jump straight
to the interests we have in common.

From time to time, I come across people who persistently ask, "But
what do you *do*? What's your day job?" I confess it's a bit fun to
tweak the box they want to put me in. One approach I've heard other
people use is to playfully acknowledge the difficulty of
categorization. "On Mondays, I ___. On Tuesdays, I ___. On Wednesdays,
I___. ..." Others gleefully embrace descriptions like "I'm
unemployed."

But I'm missing the purpose of that introductory phrase or that short
bio here. It's not about shaking up the other person's worldview. At
its best, that occupational association helps the listener or reader
quickly grasp an idea of the other person's life and where the other
person is coming from. An accountant probably has a different way of
looking at things than a primary school teacher does. One's occupation
provides the other person with the ability to contextualize what one
says ("Oh, of course she thinks of things as systems and processes;
she works with code all day."). During small talk, it gives people
easy things to talk about while they're waiting for a more interesting
topic of conversation to appear: "What kinds of things do you write?"

Let's say, then, that my goals for this phrase would be:
- to help people understand my context quickly, and how that might differ from their perspective
- to make the other person more comfortable by:
  - being able to associate me with a stereotype that adds
    information, possibly fleshing out this mental profile with
    differences later on
  - in conversation, letting them easily think of questions to ask,
    addressing the [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/][phatic nature]] of small talk (we're not actually
    *talking*, we're making polite noises)
- to branch off into more interesting conversations, avoiding the
  dead-end that often comes up after the ritualistic exchange of "What
  do you do?"

Of these goals, I like the third (interesting conversations) the most.

Here are a few of my options:

- I can accept convention and pick one aspect of what I do, especially
  if I tailor it to their interests. For example, at a business event,
  I might introduce myself as a social business consultant who helps
  really large companies improve internal collaboration through
  analytics and custom development for enterprise social network
  platforms (well, isn't *that* a mouthful). At visual thinking
  events, I might introduce myself as a sketchnoter focusing on
  exploring my own ideas.
- I can waffle by introducing several aspects, still within the
  vocabulary of regular occupations: a consultant and a writer, for
  example.
- I can say, "It's complicated!" and explain my 5-year experiment,
  self-directed living, and learning/coding/writing/drawing/sharing.

Anyway, circling back to this writer and his likely use of some kind
of occupation as a way to introduce and contextualize me:

- It might be interesting to play with *no* occupational
  categorization. Some context may be provided by age (31) - it's
  common enough in newspapers and books. The editor might send it back
  with a question, "Yes, but what does she do?", but there it is.
- It might also be interesting to play with my difficulty of
  categorization. "Sacha Chua, who couldn't come up with a single
  phrase to describe her occupation, ..."
- Or, since it's no skin off my back if this is not fully
  representative, I could just let him write whatever he wants to
  write. Freelance consultant. Blogger. Sketchnoter. Amateur
  experimenter. Independent developer. "Consultant" is a very small
  part of my identity, actually, so developer or blogger might be
  interesting. A possible missed opportunity here is that the wrong
  frame might result in people not being able to identify with and
  learn from stuff ("Of course she can deal with this, she's a coder";
  "Bah, another blogger, is that all she does?"; "Why should I listen
  to her? Freelance is just a fancy word for unemployed."). But it'll
  do under time pressure. =)

I'm writing this on January 14 and posting this in the future (because
I limit posts to one a day), so the article will likely be out by now.
If I remember, I'll update this with what he actually used. =) But I
needed to think about it out loud, and I'm sure the situation will
come up again in the future. Perhaps by then I'll have a more compact
way to describe myself.

Since other people have figured this out before, I can learn from
them. (And possibly from you!) After all, I'm nowhere near as
interesting as Benjamin Franklin or Leonardo da Vinci, and somehow
*they* managed to settle down into a sequence of nouns. Here's the one
from Wikipedia's entry for Leonardo da Vinci:

#+begin_quote
Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an
Italian painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician,
engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and
writer.

People can pick whatever aspect they want. I am multi-faceted and
growing. =)

Someone asked:

#+begin_quote
One issue I have is prioritization. I sometimes find myself spending a
lot of time on low-impact activities. How do you tackle this in your
life? What's the most important thing you're working on right now?
#+end_quote

*How much time do you actually have?*

It's easy to feel that most of your time is taken up with trivial
things. There's taking care of yourself and the household. There are
endless tasks to check off to-do lists. There's paperwork and
overhead.

I track my time, so I /know/ I spend a lot of my time on the general
running of things. November was weird, so let me analyze October 2014
instead. A quick summary from my time-tracking gives me these numbers.
Out of the 744 hours in October, I used:

| Hours | Activity                            |
|-------+-------------------------------------|
| 255.0 | sleep                               |
| 126.3 | *consulting*                        |
|  91.9 | doing other business-related things |
|  80.5 | chores and other unpaid work        |
|  86.2 | taking care of myself               |
|  38.3 | playing, relaxing                   |
|  30.4 | family-related stuff                |
|  12.6 | socializing                         |
|  10.3 | *writing*                           |
|   7.4 | *working on Emacs*                  |
|   1.5 | gardening                           |
|   1.0 | reading                             |
|   0.5 | tracking                            |
|   1.7 | woodworking                         |

Assuming that my consulting, writing, and working on Emacs are the
activities that have some impact on the wider world, that's 144 hours
out of 744, or about 19% of all the time I have. This is roughly 4.5
hours a day. (And that's a generous assumption - many of the things I
write are personal reflections of uncertain value to other people.)

Even with tons of control over my schedule, I also spend lots of
time on low-impact activities.

And this is okay. I'm fine with that. I don't need to turn into a
value-creating machine entirely devoted to the pursuit of one clear
goal. I don't think I even can. It works for other people, but not for
me. I like the time I spend cooking and helping out around the house.
I like the time I spend playing with interesting ideas. I like the
pace I keep.

So I'm going to start with the assumption that *this is the time that
I can work with* instead of being frustrated with the other things
that fill my life. This is different from the mindset that I find in
many productivity and time management books, I think, where the rest
of your life is often treated as something that gets in the way of
your Real Work. (Are you kidding? The time that I spend snuggling with
W- or the cats - that's Real Life right there, for me, and I'm often
all too aware of how short life is.) This low-impact stuff is what
grounds me and makes me human.

*Preparing*

And when I'm alert and I have the time to dig into something deeply?
(Which I often do, since I keep my schedule relatively uncluttered by
commitments.) Then I want to have stuff ready to work on and ideas to
explore. That way, *I can work on whatever I feel like working on.*
Why waste energy fighting yourself and forcing yourself to work on one
important thing, when you can choose from [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/03/reflecting-goals-time/][a buffet of good options]]?
(March 2014)

This sounds like a recipe for procrastination, an easy way for
near-term pleasurable tasks to crowd out important but tedious ones.

*But I also ask myself:*
- *Why do I feel like doing various things?* Is there an underlying
  cause or unmet need that I can address? Am I avoiding something
  because I don't understand it or myself well enough? Do I only think
  that I want something, or do I really want it? I do a lot of this
  thinking and planning throughout my life, so that when those awesome
  hours come when everything's lined up and I'm ready to make
  something, I can just go and do it.
- *Can I tweak how I feel about things* by emphasizing positive
  aspects or de-emphasizing negative ones? What can I enjoy about the
  things that are good for me? What can I dislike about the things
  that are bad for me?
- *What can I do now to make things better later?* How can I take
  advantage of those moments when I'm focused and everything comes
  together? How can I make better use of normal moments? How can I
  make better use of the gray times too, when I'm feeling bleah?
- *How can I slowly accumulate value?* How can I scale up by making
  things available?

I don't really work with a grand vision or a sense of importance. I
don't need to make big jumps. I'm delighted (and somewhat mystified)
when other people tell me that they found my blog posts or resources
useful. Even if I proceed at my current pace--for example,
accumulating a blog post a day--in twenty years, I'll probably be
somewhere interesting.

What that usually works out to is that I use my time to learn
something, writing and drawing along the way. I've been blogging for
the past twelve years or so. It's incredible how those notes have
helped me remember things, and how even the little things I learn can
turn out to be surprisingly useful.

I might never do anything Important Enough to show up in the history
books or get a Wikipedia page. But hey, if I help people save a little
time, tickle their brains, or help them learn stuff, maybe they will.
=)

And I'm really curious about what, say, learning out loud for 50 years
can tell us. I love reading about how people kept journals and
commonplace books of the things they learn, but what we can do now is
so different from those personal notes back then. Now we can open up
our notes for other people to search or learn from or be inspired by.
Now we have conversations that grow out of notes we've forgotten
writing. So maybe that's the Important Thing that I'm working on, but
I won't know what the results are like until decades have passed.

Hmm. I think how I deal with prioritization is to:
- *Embrace your limits.* Don't stress out about not being 100%
  productive or dedicated. Accept that there will be times when you're
  distracted or sick, and there will be times when you're focused and
  you can do lots of good stuff. Accepting this still lets you tweak
  your limits, but you can do that with a spirit of loving kindness
  instead of frustration.
- *Understand yourself and play with what you think about things.*
  Instead of fighting motivation head-on, approach it sideways by
  asking questions and choosing what to focus your awareness on.
- *Prepare.* You can get a decent amount done normally, and sometimes
  you can get a lot more done because you have a lot more energy or
  concentration. Even when you don't feel on top of the game, you can
  prepare so that you can make the most of the moments when you do
  (and get some things done even when you don't). For a writer, that
  might mean keeping lots of outlines and ideas around. For a
  developer, that might mean reading documentation and sketching out
  plans. There's so much you can do to lay the groundwork.
- *Accumulate gradual progress.* Sometimes you only /feel/ like you're
  not making any progress because you don't see how far you've come.
  Your memory is fuzzy and will lie to you. Take notes. Better yet,
  share those notes. Then you can see how your journey of a thousand
  miles is made up of all those little steps you've been taking - and
  you might even be able to help out or connect with other people
  along the way.

Hope that helps!

Study cannot be helpful unless you take pains to live simply; and living simply is voluntary poverty.  Away, then, with all excuses like: "I have not yet enough; when I have gained the desired amount, then I shall devote myself wholly to philosophy." And yet this ideal, which you are putting off and placing second to other interests, should be secured first of all; you should begin with it. You retort: "I wish to acquire something to live on." Yes, but learn while you are acquiring it; for if anything forbids you to live nobly, nothing forbids you to die nobly.

*** A day at leisure

Two of my friends were hanging out at a park, so I decided to join
them. It was a leisurely afternoon of sunshine, idle conversation, and ice
cream. In the evening, we watched a movie--which turned out to be free
because of projector issues.

Come to think of it, I rarely choose a pace as slow as that, but
sometimes I enjoy it. Weekends, we do chores and get ready for the
next week, with some time for reading and writing and other interests.
During my non-consulting weekdays, I'm often writing or learning or
trying something new. Even the long walks I occasionally take feel a
little purposeful.

Sometimes the time I spend with W- is like that, like when we go for
bike rides or movies or dinner. Most of the times, we relax through
activity.

With friends, I tend towards slow time rather than active time. But I
catch myself being occasionally hesitant about spending time with
other people, because sometimes I want to be fast instead of slow, or
I want to do something else, and I'm not sure if people will take it
the wrong way.

Anyway, when things line up, that feels good.

In /Creating a Good Life: Applying Aristotle's Wisdom to Find Meaning and Happiness/ (O'Toole and Isaacson, 2005), the authors suggest the following questions for reflection:

- To what extent do I behave in intemperate ways?
- How can I build the habits of temperance and right desire?
- What activities do I currently find pleasurable, but which prevent me from becoming happy in the long term?
- What activity do I engage in with others that gives me so much pleasure that I lose my intemperate desires in the process?

I have time data going back to November 2011. This helps me review my day objectively, seeing the times when

What activities do I engage in for short-term benefits, but which
might be taking time away from other things I could do for my
long-term happiness if I let them run away with me?


What else am I sometimes intemperate in? I sleep a lot - about 8.6
hours a day, and not always because I need it. Sometimes I stay in bed
mentally running through different scenarios. It's still within the
healthy range, though.

Sometimes I have bursts of watching videos or reading comics.

Aristotle splits up leisure into amusement (passive entertainment), recreation (active exertion), and contemplation (building understanding).

          building those skills, then I'll feel all right doing more work.
        - I say yes to work when my teammates need help with their workload. I'm okay with weekends and holidays because I get plenty of discretionary
          time during the week. This probably means I can take on more work if my teammates feel overloaded, if they think it's good value. (Happiness
          is worth it.)

- How would I use extra income?  :toblog:
    - *Save more:* make our safety buffer bigger, start working on W-'s retirement. Easy path.
    - *Live more:* replace activities we don't particularly like doing with more discretionary time, or add more relaxation/life stuff (massages)
        - Most of my tasks give me personal benefit, and I don't want to get used to lifestyle inflation
        - It feels wasteful to pay for chores (ex: washing the dishes, cooking food), especially as I get a lot of enjoyment out of those activities
          too (washing dishes = creative downtime, cooking food = family)
        - Not likely to pursue this path
    - *Earn more:* replace activities we don't particularly like doing with more work time
        - I earn more than I would pay someone for the tasks I would replace
        - If I could, say, work one hour and hire out or accelerate three hours (net gain of two hours)
        - but my limiting factor isn't really time, and the things I want to invest in don't have an immediate time=money result, so it blends into the next category...
    - *Learn more:* replace activities with more learning and making
        - Do I get more value out of building those life skills now instead of earning money to buy the time later?
            - Three steps: work more, delegate more, and then fill that time with something productive
            - versus working less (or the same) and directly filling the time with something productive
        - comparative advantage if
            - working more lets me give myself permission to invest in more tools and education, speeding up learning/doing by 2-3x
            - working 1 hour lets me free up 2-3 hours with minimal admin overhead.
    - Actually, I would want to bank at least half of any extra. So I should make a business plan that looks for twice the ROI.
        - Oh, there's an idea there... Maybe I should make a "business plan" for my learning, and identify where I can accelerate it.
- How would I invest in specifics?
    - *What are the activities I could reduce?*
        - Grocery shopping and library errands - revisit my online grocery shopping experiment?
            - Social time with W-
            - 15% premium for 1 hour per week; time spent shopping online, so maybe 45 min saved per week?
        - Litter-box cleaning: ~15min/day. Tried paying J- to do it, but offer not motivating enough for her. Doesn't make sense to have someone else come in and do it. Should take on other chores to offset...
        - Weekly laundry: pretty easy. Social time with W-, and watching movies.
        - Weekly or bi-weekly cleaning
        - Offset some of W-'s activities, such as working on the deck?
        - Video games?
        - Actually, my life is pretty trim
    - *What are the activities I could invest in?* TODO Post this as a quick question - what would people like me to invest more into?
        - *Writing:* Buy recent books instead of relying on the library. Give stuff away. Invest time in formatting, or pay someone to format. Interview people and send them gift certificates. Go for a course. Get a coach. Experiment with writing topic-focused blogs and delegation. Buy premium plugins or themes. Pay a designer, coder, editor, or social media person. Get things transcribed. Learn how to work with writers?
            - Platform University? Copyblogger? ProBlogger Academy? Firepole Marketing?
            - Let's say that I want writing to become a larger stream of income. What would I need to do?
                - Plan content
                - Reach out to people (bloggers, potential community)
                - Create, organize, and format content
                - Put content up for sale
        - *Drawing:* Get and learn how to use Illustrator, maybe once we've got a Windows desktop set up. Learn 3D modeling, buy models. Learn animation, buy tools.
        - *Coding:* Buy premium plugins, scripts or themes. Experiment with digital delivery systems when Gumroad volume gets large enough. Have someone I can send technical questions to with payment or gifts of appreciation? Maybe indirectly through my blog - send more gift certificates?
        - *Connecting:* Treat people to food (either at home or outside) - maybe outside so that I don't feel self-conscious about home. Visit family and friends in the Philippines. (Don't want to trade off time with W-, though.) Learn how to make or buy gifts. Buy stamps. Buy ingredients and make HackLab dinners. Schedule more get-togethers with people.
        - *Making:* Take a class (cooking, sewing, home maintenance)
            - Take a cooking class? I can buy a lot of ingredients with that money.
            - Sewing class? Took one. YouTube is amazing and convenient. Class interactivity wasn't that compelling. Other people have learned this before, and I can too.
            - Home maintenance skills? Checking for workshops
        - *Fitness:* Sign up for classes. Rotate through classes/gyms a month at a time until I find something I love. Make biking in winter safer and more comfortable.
- It's easier to think of investing time rather than money. I've got lots of ideas for investing time.
    - So maybe it makes sense to keep my surplus as time instead of converting it into money...
- What's another approach?
    - Keep my unpaid work and earning time the same
    - Plan for a reduction in earning time, so I know what activities will take the surplus time and I can direct it instead of frittering it away
    - Minimize external commitments; refer work to other people instead of taking on time=money trades
    - Force myself to double-down on creating content that's useful for other people
- http://www.bathrobemillionaire.com/2011/09/07/should-you-reinvest-in-your-business/
    - Reinvesting needs to beat what I can get elsewhere. Good test: profit, inexpensive test, greater return of profit.

 Decisions
- I'll probably step up consulting a little because things are working well. Maybe 2.5 days a week instead of 2, maybe
 even 3 if the balance keeps and the budget holds.
- I'll refer other time=money swaps to people, doing only what I need to do. This builds a network of skills.
- I'll save surplus money instead of making myself use it.
- As consulting winds down, I'll assign the surplus time to creating content, getting really good at writing and drawing and reaching out.
- I'll start "banking" evergreen posts until I reach enough that it makes sense to create a topic-focused blog. This gets around my worry that it will be a stale one. Maybe 12, 26, or 52? Likely candidates: sketchnoting, blogging, personal finance.
- I *won't* throw money at the problem. I'll pretend that I'm bootstrapping content. I'll use my opportunity fund for small experiments or good wins, gradually scaling it up.

I predict that these decisions will:
- Give me a comfortable safety buffer
- Keep me hungry and creative instead of letting me make lazy decisions about tools or delegation
- Limit my growth a little, but keep it manageable


- what are my decision criteria?
    - in line with my interests, focus areas, and desired skills
        - scalable, public
    - low commitment
    - focus on creating? get paid to learn by helping?
- what would I do if I weren't doing that?
    - write
    - draw
    - code
    - play
    - spend time with people
    - read
- I have enough time for those things. I don't feel time-starved. Transform cognitive surplus?
- More money, same lifestyle
    - more safety
    - help W- get closer to "retirement" too
- What does this allow me to do?
    - Be picky
    - Dig into the business case
- Some thoughts
    - What if I can create more value by helping other people rather than trying to dig up or make things on my own?
        - Maybe. But other people can also help, and I can build relationships by referring
    - What if I can improve my skills faster with external requests instead of internal motivation?
        - I want to get better at internal motivation anyway
    - Where do I offer value that is difficult to substitute?
        - Drawing: particular style, technology; early adopter for digital sketchnoting, although I hope it will become more popular
            - I'd rather encourage people to draw than make them reliant on my drawings
                - Can I channel requests to sketchnotearmy.com? That would be the best, I think. Start with job posts, get more people handling virtual or in-person requests.
            - I'd rather build relationships than sell, sell, sell. (Although I'm open to being compensated.)
                - Build the network for 10 years down the road.
    - How do I feel confident about business?
        - Do the accounting
        - Keep on consulting while it makes sense and I can create value
        - Write, draw: build resources instead of trading time for money
            - Even if I start off creating less value
    - Arguing the opposite
from consulting or significant benefit from illustration
                - Benefit from illustration: learn about interesting topics? plenty to do on my own
        - Build a professional network
- Some options
    - No unless compelling case
        -
- Reconsider as I get closer to my experiment re-evaluation date



- what do I want to do more of?

*** Not busy

*People sometimes get the impression that I'm this super-busy, super-productive person. I'm not.* Thanks to this experiment with semi-retirement, I'm probably the least busy person I know, at least in terms of people less than 60 years old. I try to get one or two good things done each day. The difference, I suppose, is that I write about it, so the days don't blur together and I can actually tell you where the time went.

I try hard to not be busy. I minimize the number of commitments I make. I still occasionally turn down invitations or requests, but I'm up front about my reasons. It's not that I'm busy, I've just got other priorities. It's not that I'm busy, it's that I'm tired and want to sleep in. It's not that I'm busy, it's that I don't feel up to it right now. (Introvert mode strikes again.) It's not that I'm busy, I just want to keep the time open so I can follow where my interests lead me.



There are two types of balance that I pay attention to. One is my bank balance, of course. As long as it remains comfortably high, I'm okay.

The other balance, the more important one, is the balance of how W-
feels about this experiment. He works long hours, although he's also
got great work-life balance and enjoys the occasional walk to the
library while his code compiles.

I work more than I estimated I needed. I'm keeping the same frugal lifestyle, but the excess can go towards our safety buffer and possibly his early retirement too.


Sometimes I give myself permission to play video games most of the
afternoon, after learning interesting things and writing several blog
posts along the way.

*** Learning how to be
This is probably the hardest part of semi-retirement: learning how to
be. Learning to let go of the need to check things off a list or do
things that I consider productive. Learning how to ignore the clock
and follow the flow.

Look, I'm writing a blog post instead of staring off into space. This
time, I'm not starting with an outline. We'll just see where this post
goes.

It's not all "work." I sleep in, and I go for walks, and I get on my
bike and go to places even if I don't need to. I cook and I read and I
garden. I tidy. I play video games.

They're still all verbs. That's okay. The goal isn't to do /nothing/,
the goal is to be where I am: unhurried, present, not frustrated, not
judging myself for what I do or don't do.

Pretty good, actually.

People occasionally ask me what it would take for me to consider
stopping my experiment early and go back to full-time work. On
reflection, I think the answer is: unfortunate circumstances, depleted
savings, or other family needs. (I don't recommend setting me up for
this!)

It's a little odd realizing that I can't think of any positive things
that would tempt me away from this path for the next few years, not
even being offered another job tailored to my interests and skills. If
people offered a ridiculously high salary, I would question the sanity
and longevity of the company; if they offered a more reasonable one,
I'd pick the freedom and the flexibility of the experiment. We have
enough for our needs and few wants.

I have a few 8 AM meetings this week. I don't /really/ have to go, but
I think it would be useful and good for the team, so I go and
contribute as much as I can. The downside is that my brain is fuzzy
the rest of the day, although a short nap or break is remarkably
restorative. I can nap easily when I'm at Hacklab. When I am with my
consulting client, napping is harder to arrange, so I typically head
home early.

I experimented with going to a breakfast meetup. I made it there early
and was alert enough to [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/14605456916/][take notes]], but found myself mentally drifting
afterwards. I read some nonfiction, then idled a while reading blogs,
and then finally gave in to my better judgment and took a half-hour
nap. Post-nap I can read and understand bigger thoughts, and now I can
write.

I find that having less than eight hours of sleep the night before
generally leads to this sort of fuzziness, which could be avoided,
perhaps, if I just went to bed earlier. Despite efforts, somehow the
rhythms of our household life lead to me going to bed some time
between 11:30 PM and 12:30 PM unless I am very tired. (Otherwise, if I
go to bed too early, I often end up fidgeting.) I get up between 8 to
9 AM, sometimes even 10 or 11. The morning's routines take me an hour,
which means I can have brunch, then settle in for a few hours of
writing or reading. The occasional early morning is easier to
accommodate as a one-off than to shift my routines earlier in general.

I'm in the garden almost every day. Almost 40 hours in total since
the beginning of April. It's my new favourite transition activity
before dinner. I plant, water, pick off bugs. I'm beginning to learn
what leaves feel like when they haven't gotten enough water and when
they have. The oregano, mint, cilantro, basil, and lettuce are growing
much better than they did in previous years. None of the snow peas
have made it indoors yet, since I've been eating them off the vine.
The tomatoes, zucchini, winter melons, and bitter melons haven't hit
their stride yet, but maybe during the hotter months.

I like filling the salad spinner with cut-and-come-again leaves. I
should let some of the plants go to seed so that I can collect them
for the next batch, but it's too tempting to snip off the flowers in
order to keep the current batch going. I planted a salad mix, so I
have no idea what some of these are. I know bok choy, spinach,
arugula. Peppery and red-veined? Probably beet greens. I'm relying on
frequency here. If there's a lot of a type of plant, it grows in a
somewhat regular formation, and I don't already conclusively know it's
a weed, it's probably okay to eat. So far, so good.

I have salad every other day or so. Today I had three small bowls of
salad all by myself (W- had the other bowl). I shook up a quick
Asian-style dressing in a small mason jar and sprinkled sesame seeds
on top. We don't normally buy those boxes of salad mix, since I feel
guilty about not finishing them before they have to go. If it's still
growing, I don't mind, although I try to harvest leaves before the
slugs and leaf-miners get to them.

The salad garden is doing so much better this year compared to [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/10/gardening-review-2013/][last
year]]. Frequent watering and frequent harvesting, that's probably the
ticket. I should make pesto this week. Maybe Wednesday. Basil likes
being harvested often, too. =) I've been picking flowers off every
day, but there are definitely enough leaves here to make a good-sized
batch of pesto.

When I build a tool for other people to use and I want to store data,
I usually have to think in terms of relational databases: tables,
fields, and queries. There are other kinds of databases out there,
like ones with flexible documents or ones that are optimized for
graphs, but I haven't gotten the hang of them yet.

When I build a tool for myself and I want to store data, I usually use
plain text. (Or _maybe_ a spreadsheet, but now that I'm getting the
hang of [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/getting-data-org-mode-tables/][Org Mode tables]], I'm leaning more and more towards text.)

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16242089990/][2015-02-02 Plain text -- index card #data #organization #pkm #org]]

I like the flexibility of plain text. Sometimes I want to organize my
thoughts in an [[http://sachachua.com/outline][outline]] or an [[http://sachachua.com/index][index]]. Sometimes I want to make a graph,
like the way I wanted to visualize how my [[http://sachachua.com/evil-plans][goals]] are related to each
other. Sometimes I change my mind about what I want. (All the time,
actually. =) ) Plain text lets me add structure the way I want to.
It's all in my text editor, so I can move things around or reorganize
things using the tools in Emacs.

Sure, sometimes I mess up because of formatting mistakes or the lack
of validation. For example, typos in my personal ledger show up when
the numbers don't match my bank balances or there's a new category
with a misspelled name. But these are easy enough to catch and fix,
and I can't completely guard against them with a database anyway. And
it's nice to know that version control can let me visually step
through the changes or recover from mistakes.

What about speed? Databases can be much faster than plain text for
large quantities of data, for sure. I tend to work with pretty small
quantities of data. For example, my blog index has 3257 lines, and the
file that I'm drafting this in is under a megabyte. Even with whatever
Emacs Lisp I've written to extract or cross-reference data, I'm still
mostly bottlenecked by my brain instead of my computer. Sure, it took
me a little longer to figure out how to do table calculations using
Org Mode, but now that I have some notes on that, I should be able to
come up with future calculations more easily. Besides, if I need to
analyze things quickly, I can export and then crunch the numbers using
a different tool.

Speaking of tools, staying with lightly-structured plain text lets me
build a toolkit of text manipulation techniques. When I'm editing
things in Emacs, scripting with Emacs Lisp, searching with grep, or
writing Javascript/Ruby/Perl code to work with text, I'm developing
skills that I can use in a wide range of situations.

If you're interested in keeping your data in plain text with Org Mode,
here are some tips that can help you learn how to work with your
information.

*** Start with tables

1. Learn how to use keyboard shortcuts to create, move, or delete rows and columns.
2. Learn how to sort tables.
2. Learn how to use the column with specifier (ex: =<10>=) to limit
   the displayed size of your column while still being able to add
   more information.
3. Use Org Mode's support for calculations to do math or perform other
   operations on your table.

*** Consider using properties

Org tables don't do well with paragraphs or more complex information, so you might want to use Org subtrees with properties.

You can use Org columns to display property values, or use Org dynamic
blocks to put a summary of the values into your Org Mode file. See
=org-collector.el= for a =propview= report.

If you want more control, you can work with the information using
Emacs Lisp. You can use =org-entry-get=,
=org-entry-get-multivalued-property=, or
=org-entry-get-with-inheritance= to get the value of the property. If
you want to go through all the subtrees (or a subset of them), use
=org-map-entries= to call your own function at each of the matching
headlines in the scope. =org-heading-components= will give you the
information from the current heading, and you can use
=org-end-of-subtree= to give you the boundary of the subtree if you
want to process it further.

You can parse Org Mode lists with =org-list-struct=. I haven't dug
into this deeply yet, but it looks interesting.

*** Parse free-form text

In addition to working with tables and properties, you can write
functions that use regular expressions or other techniques to extract
data from text. =re-builder= can be useful for visual feedback while
you're figuring out the right regular expression to build. Remember,
you're in Emacs, so you don't have to come up with the perfect regular
expression that extracts all the data in one go. You can search for a
regular expression, use a command like =forward-line=, save something
to a variable, and so forth. Try thinking about how you would do
something by hand, and then using =repeat-complex-command= to see what
functions Emacs called when you did that.

=save-restriction=, =narrow-to-region=, and =save-excursion= are very
useful when it comes to limiting the scope of your processing or
saving your position, so check them out in the Emacs Lisp manual.

I find plain text to be really useful when I'm figuring things out
(so, all the time), since I don't have to build a complex interface
for working with it. As I learn more about Org Mode's features, I find
myself using it for more and more of my data. Org's slogan is
"Organize your life in plain text!" -- and I think it just might be
serious about that!

[[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] is an amazingly powerful package for Emacs. I've been
learning a lot about how to use its support for plain-text tables and
spreadsheet calculations.

*** Using table data in Emacs Lisp with the :var argument

For example, I wanted to be able to define my abbreviations in an Org
Mode table in my config. I remembered coming across this technique a
few weeks ago, but I couldn't find the webpage with the code. It
turned out to be simple to write from scratch. Here's the plain text I
added to my config.

#+begin_src org
,#+NAME: abbrev
| Base  | Expansion                             |
|-------+---------------------------------------|
| bc    | because                               |
| wo    | without                               |
| wi    | with                                  |
| ex    | For example,                          |
| email | sacha@sachachua.com                   |
| dote  | http://sachachua.com/dotemacs         |
| web   | http://sachachua.com/                 |
| blog  | http://sachachua.com/blog/            |
| ec    | http://sachachua.com/blog/emacs-chat/ |

,#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code :var data=abbrev
(mapc (lambda (x) (define-global-abbrev (car x) (cadr x))) data)
,#+end_src
#+end_src

The =:var data=abbrev= argument to the Emacs Lisp source block is
where all the magic happens. Here, it takes the data from the table
named "abbrev" (which I set using =#+NAME:= before the table) and
makes it available to the code. Emacs evaluates that data when the
code is tangled (or exported) to my configuration. The code that's
in my =Sacha.el= looks like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (let ((data (quote (("bc" "because")
                      ("wo" "without")
                      ("wi" "with")
                      ("ex" "For example,")
                      ("email" "sacha@sachachua.com")
                      ("dote" "http://sachachua.com/dotemacs")
                      ("web" "http://sachachua.com/")
                      ("blog" "http://sachachua.com/blog/")
                      ("ec" "http://sachachua.com/blog/emacs-chat/")))))
    (mapc (lambda (x) (define-global-abbrev (car x) (cadr x))) data) )
#+end_src

*** Looking up data with org-lookup-first, org-lookup-last, and org-lookup-all

You can do more complex things with Org tables, too. Inspired by Eric Boyd's talk on his [[http://quest.digitalcrusader.ca][Epic Quest of Awesome]] (which he based on [[http://nerdfitness.com/blog/epic-quest/][Steve Kamb]]'s), I started putting together [[pages.sachachua.com/evil-plans/quest.html][my own]]. I made a list of little achievements, guessed at the years, and assigned arbitrary experience points.

The *achievements* table had rows like this:

| Approximate date | Category    |  XP | Description                                                                                   | ID     |
|------------------+-------------+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------|
|             2014 | Life        |  50 | Became a Canadian citizen - [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/09/becoming-filipino-canadian/][link]]                                                              | L_CAN  |
|             2014 | Programming |  20 | Used NodeJS and AngularJS for a client project - [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/09/yay-rocked/][link]]                                         | P_NOD  |
|             2014 | Programming |   5 | Pulled information out of Evernote                                                            |        |

I wanted to summarize the points by year: points gained, total points, level (according to a lookup table based on D&D experience points), and description. The lookup table was structured like this:

#+begin_src org
,#+TBLNAME: levels
| Total XP | Level | Adjective             |
|----------+-------+-----------------------|
|        0 |     1 | trained-initiate      |
|     1000 |     2 | experienced           |
|     2250 |     3 | savvy                 |
|     3750 |     4 | veteran               |
|     5500 |     5 | unusually experienced |
#+end_src

Now for the summary table. I created rows for different years, and then I used Org Mode to fill in the rest. (Org Mode! Wow.)

#+begin_src org
| Year | Points gained | Cumulative points | Level | Adjective        |
|------+---------------+-------------------+-------+------------------|
| 1997 |             0 |                 0 |     1 | trained-initiate |

,#+TBLFM: $2='(calc-eval (format "vsum(%s)" (vconcat (org-lookup-all $1 '(remote(accomplishments,@2$1..@>$1)) '(remote(accomplishments,@2$3..@>$3))))))::$3=vsum(@2$2..@+0$2)::$4='(org-lookup-last $3 '(remote(levels,@2$1..@>$1)) '(remote(levels,@2$2..@>$2)) '>=);N::$5='(org-lookup-last $3 '(remote(levels,@2$1..@>$1)) '(remote(levels,@2$3..@>$3)) '>=);L
#+end_src

The =TBLFM= (table formula) line is very long, so let me break it down.

*Points gained:*

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (calc-eval
   (format "vsum(%s)"
           (vconcat
            (org-lookup-all
             $1
             '(remote(accomplishments,@2$1..@>$1))
             '(remote(accomplishments,@2$3..@>$3))))))
#+end_src

This uses =org-lookup-all= to look up the value of the first column
(=$1=) in the =accomplishments= table, from the second row to the last
row =@2..@>=, looking in the first column (=$1=). It returns the
values from the third column of the matching rows (=$3=). This is then
passed through calc's =vsum= function to calculate the sum.

*Cumulative points:* =vsum(@2$2..@+0$2)= is the sum of the second column =$2= from the second row =@2= to the current row =@+0=.

*Level:* This uses =org-lookup-last= to find the last value where the
operator function returns true. In this case, testing the level from
column =$3= against each of the values in the =levels= table's column
=$1= while the given level is greater than or equal to the value from
=levels=. When it finds the last matching row, it returns the =$2=
second column from it. =;N= means treat everything as a number.

=org-lookup-first= is like =org-lookup-last=, but it returns the first
matching row.

*Adjective:* This one works like *Level* does, but it returns the
value from column =$3= instead. I found that it converted the return
values to =0= if I used =;N=, so I used =;L= instead.

*** Passing data to R or other external programs

Of course, you're not limited to things that Emacs can do. I wanted to summarize the data in graphs, so here's what I did.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ,#+RESULTS: category_analysis

 ,#+name: category_analysis
 ,#+begin_src R :var data=accomplishments :exports both :results graphics :file quest_category.png :height 300
 library(plyr)
 library(ggplot2)
 categories <- ddply(data, c("Category"), summarize, Points=sum(XP))
 cat_sorted <- transform(categories, Category=reorder(Category, Points))
 plot <- ggplot(data = cat_sorted, aes(x = Category, y = Points))
 plot <- plot + geom_bar(stat="identity")
 plot <- plot + geom_text(aes(label = Points, x = Category, y = Points + 10, hjust=0))
 plot <- plot + scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,70))
 plot <- plot + coord_flip()
 print(plot)
 ,#+end_src
#+end_src

I like including source code in published pages for fellow geeks, but having the results come first gives people more context for the source block. So I named the source block using the =#+name:= directive and defined a =#+RESULTS:= directive before it. The source block used the =:var= argument to bring the data in from the =accomplishments= table. With R blocks, the data becomes available as a data frame that you can then do interesting things with. I used the =:file= argument to save the output to =quest_category.png=.

Those are a few ways that you can get data out of Org Mode tables and
into Emacs Lisp, other Org Mode tables, or external programs. As I
learn more about Org Mode, I find myself using it for more of the
things that I used to use Microsoft Excel for - tracking, analyzing,
and even graphing. I found it a little difficult to piece together
what I needed to do from the manuals and examples on the Web, so I
hope this explanation will help you (and that it'll help me when I
forget the syntax, as I'm sure I will). If you come up with something
really neat that uses Org Mode tables, tell me what you've figured
out!

We have a computer downstairs with backups of files, and I've been using it to explore Vagrant and development using virtual machines as well. It can be useful to be able to SSH into it from outside our network, so I spent some time setting up a dynamic domain name, port forwarding, and new limits for the SSH server.

[[http://namecheap.com][Namecheap]] (the domain name registrar that I use) supports dynamic domains, so it was easy to enable.

1. Enable dynamic domains: *Manage Domains*, choose the domain, and then choose *Dynamic DNS*. Enable it and copy the password.
2. Create an A record: Choose *All Records* and add a subdomain with a temporary address (ex: 127.0.0.1) and type *A*. Save the settings.

Our router uses the [[http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato][Tomato firmware]], which has built-in support for Namecheap and other dynamic DNS provider.

1. Click on *Basic* - *DDNS*.
2. Fill in the details for *Dynamic DNS 1*.

Before I forwarded the ports, I wanted to make sure that SSH permitted password authentication on our local network but required passphrases for external connections. [[http://blather.michaelwlucas.com/archives/818][OpenSSH: requiring keys, but allow passwords from some locations]] (Michael W. Lucas) was really helpful. I edited =/etc/ssh/sshd_config=, set =PasswordAuthentication no=, and added the following lines to the end of the file:

#+begin_example
Match Address 192.168.0.0/16
  PasswordAuthentication yes
#+end_example

(I had some problems in the beginning because I typed this as =Yes= instead of =yes=... Case matters!)

I restarted the SSH server with =service ssh restart= and confirmed that I could still SSH in.

Back to Tomato. *Port Forwarding* lets you set up forwarding rules. The port for SSH is 22, so I filled in a row with the port I wanted, the internal port, and the internal IP address of the server. I clicked *Save* (forgot to do this a few times because the button was near the end of the page) and that was that.

On Windows, I walked W- through generating a DSA public key with [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html][PuttyGEN]], loading it in [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html][Pageant]], and copying it to his =.ssh/authorized_keys2= file.

Posting this here because I'm probably going to want to do this again someday, and it took some searching around. Besides, someone might find it handy!

    - I'm worried that I don't know how to specify the work that I want. I'm worried that there'll be a mismatch of expectations. I want clear, non-self-promotional, useful articles, and the provider might think I want some search-engine optimizing fluff.
        - I can work on being clear and providing examples. Besides, getting what I _don't_ want teaches me how to specify what I do.

*** OUTLINED How I (want to) use outsourcing to help me learn more effectively
# <<outsource-learning>>

Goal: Learn, share, scale
- Package lots of e-books on a pay-what-you-can basis, or whatever
  people would like (support/subscription?)


- Learning from people
  - [ ] Identify interesting people to learn from
    - Hmm... is there a way I can do this more efficiently? Scanning
      the first 50 Google Blog Search results gets me 5
      high-quality resources, which I could probably filter just
      based on the titles alone.
    - Huh. This could be harder than I thought, because I'm not that
      happy with the resources that are out there. Maybe I should
      figure out a better strategy.
    - What do I want in terms of learning from people?
      - Write blog posts with links to other people's interesting perspectives
      - Slowly collect interesting people to follow in my feed reader
      - Keep in mind the specialties of my blog readers and other
        people who don't blog on their own
    - Possible outsourcing approach
      - SPEC: Given a topic, give me an outline or spreadsheet
       highlighting bloggers who have written good blog posts about the
       topic
        - well-written (good English, few grammar or spelling mistakes,
          good paragraph separation, maybe uses bold/color/italics for
          emphasis)
        - includes personal experiences, not just generic advice or reblogging
        - includes action items or recommendations
        - includes links to other resources (and not just
          selling content or promoting a business)
        - discussed: has at least two comments, one of which should be
          a reply from the author (unless the post is less than a week old)
        - active: at least 1 post a month, and has posted recently
      - Rubric:
        - Excellent:
          - Went through ~10 pages of Google search results and
            narrowed it down to 5-10 excellent items
          - Highlighted bloggers or websites who wrote repeatedly
            about a topic, browsing through categories or tags to find
            related posts
          - Added a short description of how the pages differ from
            each other
            differ from each other
        - Good:

    :BLOG:     sacha
    :END:

Mark suggested that I put together some tips for Quantified Self. I
think that it might be good to put together a mini-guide on how to
take small steps and learn from them. This is not new advice, but
considering the obstacles and excuses I frequently hear from people
("I don't know where to start"; "I get discouraged"; "I never stick
with things"; "I don't know how to analyze data"), there might still
be a need for it.

Here's how I got to that conclusion. First, I thought about some of
the ideas Mark suggested.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16264638301/][2015.01.12 Considering ideas for QS mini-guide -- index card #quantified #planning]]

- How to run personal experiments: formulating small, testable hypotheses; researching ideas; collecting data; analyzing data (and minimizing errors); figuring out the next step
  - Useful for people who want to try something new, but many people will find this intimidating and they'll benefit from getting started with easier frameworks like pre-built apps
- Small wins: small things to measure/try, setting yourself up for success, celebrating progress
  - Useful for people who are being blocked by their excuses. Probably the most practical (and personally interesting for me).
- Mindset shifts for Quantified Self: experiments, curiosity, testing
  - Possibly interesting, but needs to be translated into practical action
- Why track: benefits, working around limits, learning more
  - People who aren't open to the idea won't be convinced quickly. People who are into it don't need to be sold on it. Are there people on the fence?

Okay. Small wins. Actually, small steps, since we may want to play
around with the definition of a win anyway.

I jotted down some ideas and started connecting them.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15644037204/][2015.01.12 Quantified Self and small steps -- index card #quantified]]

If I put together a guide, I could synthesize insights from the following books:
- /The Power of Habit/ (Duhigg, 2012): the habit loop, triggers, rewards, and replacing habits
- /The Progress Principle/ (Amabile and Kramer, 2011): small wins, daily progress on meaningful tasks, and how to nourish and catalyze
- /The Inner Game of Work/ (Gallwey, 2001): nonjudgmental awareness
- Either /The 4-Hour Chef/ (Ferriss, 2012) or /The First 20 Hours/ (Kaufman, 2013): breaking down skills and changes
Oh! There are also some books and resources about tiny habits, mini habits, or micro habits. I vaguely remember reading a paperback book from the library on the same topic some years ago, but it's not in my book notes. Hmm.

Aside from the key points from these books and other research I've come across, though, what else can I add to the conversation? I prefer not to write something already capably expressed somewhere else. It makes more sense to link to that and then build up from there. So, if I'm going to spend time and attention on this, what can I bring to it, and what do I want to get out of it?
- I'm not an expert in improving my habits, but paying attention to the details and analyzing my successes/failures can help me grow.
- I've learned something from consistently blogging and from doing regular weekly/monthly/yearly reviews for years. I've also learned something from the small decisions of my opportunity fund, figuring out productivity advice that works for me, and reducing energy I used to waste in being frustrated or self-recrimination.
- If I write small chunks of research, insights, and tips related to the key excuses, I'll have a resource that I can share the next time I hear those excuses get in someone's way.

As I wrote down my thoughts related to taking small steps, I got clearer on the challenges people face and the excuses that get in our way.

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16078924888/][2015.01.12 More thoughts about QS mini-guide -- index card #quantified #planning]]

Despite the occasional exhortation to set audacious stretch goals (like registering for a marathon when you're more of a couch potato), I think most people understand the value of taking small steps and making small goals. Popular goals tend to be outcome-focused instead of process-focused; I find process-focused goals to be better for me, and research tends to say the same too. So that's something more people can benefit from learning about. (Ooh, possibly interesting research to explore: [[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17405620801969585#.VLQ8CSvF98E][age-related differences and positive effects for process focus]]; [[http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/edu/89/1/29/][shifting from process to outcome]], [[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/JEXE.72.4.269-287][self-regulated learners]], etc.) Also, people tend to give up without realizing that they can get value from even very short, simple experiments. They get discouraged by noise and lack of progress.

I've learned that it helps to start by building awareness (without
being overly judgmental). That will help you come up with tiny tweaks.
As you learn from the experiment-, you can absorb some changes into
your daily routines.

That suggests a structure for this potential mini-guide on Quantified
Self and small steps:

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/15644036274/][2015.01.12 Structure for QS mini-guide on small steps -- index card #quantified]]

If I can connect with the excuses that people often get stuck at and address them with a few practical tips, that might help people move from feeling overwhelmed (or casually dismissive) to feeling that there might be something worthwhile that they can try.

What will this guide look and feel like?

[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16080590907/][2015.01.12 What will this QS guide look and feel like -- index card #quantified #planning]]

Ideally, I'd be able to condense the key tips onto a single page, like
the one-page summary of [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/02/excuses-guide-blogging-pdf-epub-mobi-free-also-notes-publishing/][A No-Excuses Guide to Blogging]]. Since the tips
would be more effective with research, examples, and links, it makes
sense to flesh them out into a blog post with illustrations. There's
probably enough material for more detailed blog posts for each of the
excuses or stages. How about a presentation? Blog posts are quicker to
put together or break apart for linking, but a short presentation with
links might be worth creating because it's easy to share.

I don't think I'll get all the way to that point in one week, though.
=) I can probably quickly sketch out my thoughts. I might be able to
back up a few points with research. I don't feel that I can speak
authoritatively about it yet, but if I prioritize the excuses I want
to address, I might be able to find things that will help dislodge
people and get them going.

Hmm. Possibly interesting?

** Planning and decisions

- So far, excellent!
    - Consulting
        - Developing my skills further
        - Know what I'm good at

I'm having this odd mental tangle around trying to frame my plans as though they were the plans of a corporation, a non-profit, or even a conglomerate. It's a strange thing and I'm looking forward to digging into it further. Something about non-transactional models, exploration, long-term views, tribes instead of markets or audiences... I suspect my current metaphor might be closer to science than it is to business, with a dash of music thrown in. Not that this explanation makes sense, but I think it will if I explore it a bit further. Thanks for the nudge to think about it!
*** Keep opportunity costs in mind

*** Testing your assumptions
- Most important skill
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Assumptions are helpful
  - They simplify the world
  - They make it possible to make quick decisions. Making assumptions
    helps us take advantage of our past experiences, and we can learn
    from other people's experiences as well.
  - Otherwise, you'd get stuck verifying everything
- Why is it hard
  - Don't know your assumptions
  - Intimidated by measuring
  - Don't want to be wrong
  - Behaviour is hard to change.
- Time
  - Most likely the first thing you need to examine. If you always
    feel rushed for time, you won't have the space to question and
    explore your assumptions.
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Desires
  - Identify
    - What makes you happy?
  - Observe
  - Test
- Expectations and reactions
- Money
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Communication and relationships
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Expectations
- Outlook
- Other areas
- Here are some assumptions I'm looking forward to testing
  - "Uncertainty is scary."
  - "I'm too distractable and scattered to complete writing a book."
  - "It'll be hard to find a form of exercise I like. Besides, gyms
    are often rip-offs anyway."
  - "Guest posts are more trouble than they're worth - hard to find
    people who write well and aren't spammy."

*** Decide on your criteria in advance
# <<advance-criteria>>

http://sach.ac/outline#advance-criteria

Examples:
- Trevor's story about finding a house
- Planning a menu (patterns)
- Choosing a computer

Outline:
- The difference between maximizing and satisficing [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing][more]]
- Why
  - Make decisions quickly
    - Discard choices that are obviously worse
    - Jump on opportunities
  - Make decisions more reasonably
    - Esp. if you anticipate poor decision capability
      - "Your ability to think rationally may be impaired. It is
        therefore suggested that you avoid making any important
        decisions until the effects of the medications have fully worn
        off." - from pre-procedural sedation instructions
    - Don't forget important criteria; value of a checklist
  - Make decisions consistently over time
    - Ex: hiring decisions
  - Get other people to help you look
- How
  - Decide on your criteria in advance
  - Prioritize
    - You probably won't be able to get everything
    - What's good enough?
    - Weighted scoring helps

  to write down
- Getting more comfortable making decisions that shape my life
  - Contrast: master's degree in Canada

  - Goal: Maximize payoffs and minimize risks
- Don't judge decisions by outcomes, but by processes
  - Not about regretting the outcome, but the process
  - Canada Post losing my passport: not a terrible
    decision, but not the best one, although it reminds me that I should test more
    assertive approaches like seeing if it's a real requirement

*** Something I want to get better at: Planning my way through uncertainty

- I don't know what next month will be like, or the months beyond
  that.
  - cloud of possibilities
- Scary
  - Why
    - Uncomfortable making and possibly renegotiating commitments
    - In limbo about some plans
- Uncertainty is good
  - Learning how to deal with it
  - Learning
- Good outcome
  - Not blindsided by unknown risks; have a flexible contingency plan
  - Comfortable with decisions even if they turn out badly
  - Documented decisions so that I can review and improve my
    decision-making process
  - Fire drill so that I have something in place
- How I deal with uncertainty
  - Minimize commitments
    - Unexpected perks of semi-retirement: I can be open about
      uncertainty

  - Scenario planning
    - Research
      - What's out there?
      - Which outcomes are more likely? less likely?
    - Plan for the negative scenarios
    - Plan for possibilities
- Lessons from other places
  - Lean
    - No forecasts, less waste


...deliberate attempt to separate what we do and do not know about the
future, and to use that as a basis for exploring many possible futures
... "A better approach now is to embrace uncertainty and examine it in
detail to discover where the hidden opportunities lurk."
- Paul J. H. Schoemaker (, in http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2298
- Kristel van der Elst (World Economic Forum)
  - Identify central question
  - Identify driving forces and systemic changes that will transform
    the playing field (social, technological, economic,
    environmental, (geo)political)
  - Look at things that could happen, not just extensions of the
    present
  - Determine critical uncertainties (impact vs certainty)
  - Back into decision-making process - strategy that creates value
    in several scenarios, backup plan

The point of scenario planning, after all, is not to be right, which
is such a human inclination that we find it hard to overcome—the point
of scenario planning is to see the future from perspectives we would
have a difficult time forcing ourselves to imagine because of our bias
toward rightness, and therefore imagine new possibilities or see
threats we might otherwise miss.
The trick is to know we will always be wrong as we speculate about the
future

Yet, the purpose of scenario planning is not to pinpoint future events
but to highlight large-scale forces that push the future in different
directions. It's about making these forces visible, so that if they do
happen, the planner will at least recognize them. It's about helping
make better decisions today.

- Currently underusing my Hacklab membership compared to my goals
    - As of 2013-09-25, 223 days since I joined (~ $385 in fees)
    - Original goals twice a week (~ 62 visits, $6 per visit)
    - Actual visits 41 days out of 223 days (~ 5 days between visits, $9) 66% of goal, which is actually okay
- Why not
    - The easiest thing in the world is to stay in introvert mode
    - Inertia both ways
        - At home
        - Momentum
    - Waking up late, thinking "Is it really worth biking down there for a few hours of hanging out or working?"
    - Distraction from conversation versus socialization - focus on different benefits, keep audio handy?
        - It's okay to work more slowly but with more serendipity; I have the time for this
    - Commitment to work on consulting things a couple of extra half-days a week
- Open house useful - vegan cooking lessons and inspiration, socialization, excuse to bring together
    - Can do that even as a non-member
- Expected benefits
    - Ambient socialization with interesting people
    - Ambient exposure to interesting things
    - Possible support for learning stuff (ex: hardware, electronics, 3D printing, Javascript, Haskell, neural nets)
- *Hacking my motivation*
    - *Commit to the exercise.* At least once a week (Fridays), I will bike for at least 1.5 hours including a mailbox check. I might as well use that biking time to end up at Hacklab, do some stuff, and then take the other 45 minutes on the way back.
    - *Make Hacklab the centre of my socialization.* Instead of setting up separate get-togethers with people, I will funnel people to HackLab's open house (which I will attend whenever I don't have other events). If I'm in introvert mode, I will treat the open house as cooking lessons. If I'm in socialization mode, I will catch up with people.
    - *Consider small-scale cooking on regular days.* Afternoon snacks, merienda, etc. Better with a full kitchen and a fridge.
    - *On Hacklab days, do not open the computer at home in the morning.* This gets around the momentum issue. Checking things on the phone is okay, as is working on the computer if something urgent comes up.
- What about winter?
    - Suspend membership?
    - Take TTC
        - Worth membership + $6 per day?
    - Bike on non-snowy days?
    - Mental accounting for 9 months instead of 12?
        - Less work for the treasurer, opens up possibility of dropping in
        - (/ (* 51.75 12) 41) $15 per day even with my current use. I think that's worth it considering (a) yummy vegan dinner, and (b) other coworking spaces are $20

Thanks to gardening and working on other personal projects, I'm
learning how to live one day at a time. Or at least, how to combine my
usual scenario-based planning with the acceptance that I can't plan
ahead or control some things. I pick leafminer eggs off the sorrel and
flower buds off the lettuce, I water (unless it's rained), and I wait.
Can't speed it up. The season will pass soon enough. Can't really slow
it down, either. I just have to check the boxes day by day.

I mostly live in a mix of the future and the present. Part of me lives
in the future that I'm saving and investing for, occasionally checking
how the possibilities change. Part of me is learning to live

And then there's sideways: the time I spend playing games or reading
fiction. It's neither here nor there.

The past surfaces in in-jokes, but I don't spend much time in
it aside from the occasional review where I notice

There's power in constant progress, even if it's small. You can motivate yourself in different ways. [[http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem"][Don't break the chain"]] is a popular model: keep track of the days that you work on something, count the number of consecutive days in your current streak, and eventually it will build up into a number that you're proud of. If you miss a day, you start back at 0. This works for a lot of people, but it's a bit harsher than I'd like.




Daniel Reeves, Bethany Soule, and I were chatting

- constant progress
- limitations of a chain-based approach
  - starting from 0
  - harder and harder
  - danger of internalizing "I am the sort of person who breaks the chain"

*** How does tracking affect your happiness?
*** [#C] Time-tracking workshop  :book-idea:PROJECT:
**** Session 1: The Whys and Hows of Tracking Time
Discuss objectives and motivations for tracking time. Plan possible questions you want to ask of the data (which influences which tools to try and how to collect data). Recommend a set of tools based on people’s interests and context (paper? iPhone? Android? Google Calendar?).
Resources: Presentations on time-tracking, recommendations for tools, more detail on structuring data (categories, fields); possible e-mail campaign for reminders
Output: Planning worksheet for participants to help people remember their motivations and structure their data collection; habit triggers for focused, small-scale data collection, buddying up for people who prefer social accountability
**** Session 2: Staying on the Wagon + Preliminary Analysis
Checking in to see if people are tracking time the way they want to. Online and/or one-on-one check-ins before the workshop date, plus a group session on identifying and dealing with obstacles (because it helps to know that other people struggle and overcome these things). Preliminary analysis of small-scale data.
Resources: Frequently-encountered challenges and how to deal with them; resources on habit design; tool alternatives
Output: Things to try in order to support habit change; larger-scale data collection for people who are doing well
**** Session 3: Analyzing your data
Massaging your data to fit a common format; simple analyses and interpretation
Resources: Common analysis format and some sample charts/instructions; maybe even a web service?
Output: Yay, charts!
**** Session 4: More ways you can slice and dice your data
Bring other questions you’d like to ask, and we’ll show you how to extract that out of your data (if possible – and if not, what else you’ll probably need to collect going forward). Also, understanding and using basic statistics
Resources: Basic statistics, uncommon charts
Output: More analyses!
**** Session 5: Making data part of the way you live
Building a personal dashboard, integrating your time data into your decisions
Outcome: Be able to make day-to-day decisions using your time data; become comfortable doing ad-hoc queries to find out more
**** Session 6: Designing your own experiments
Designing experiments and measuring interventions (A/B/A, how to do a blind study on yourself)
Outcome: A plan for changing one thing and measuring the impact on time
**** Session 7: Recap, Show & Tell
Participants probably have half a year of data and a personal experiment or two – hooray! Share thoughts and stories, inspire each other, and figure out what the next steps look like.
Outcome: Collection of presentations

I've used Microsoft Excel's =SUMIF= function to conditionally add up
values before. For example, =SUMIF= is handy when you have a table of
use cases and you want to sum the points for all the use cases with
priority 1. =SUMIFS= (Microsoft Excel 2007 and later) is even more
powerful - it allows you to specify multiple criteria.

*** Quantified Time: Consulting Days vs. Open Days
Does work really get in the way of living?
*** Analyzing cooking

Over a few months that we'd been tracking our grocery
spending, we spent an average of $375 each month on groceries (17%
meat, 14% fruit, 13% dairy, 11% vegetables, 7% poultry). With the two
of us and J- in the household (who usually spends weekends with her
mom), that works out to roughly 240 meals a month, or an average of
$1.88 per meal. Let's add another $1 to account for utilities,
cleaning supplies, and miscellaneous expenses, and round it off to a
total of $3/meal for materials + miscellaneous.

Between November 2, 2012 (which is when I started tracking
grocery-buying separately and somewhat reliably) and January 13, 2013,
my time logs show:

- 44:50 cooking -- this doesn't include breakfast unless I'm putting together something special, as I often lump regular breakfasts with all the rest of my morning routines
- 38:24 tidying -- let's assume that a third of that is related to cooking, so we'll use 12:48 as our number
- 13:06 buying groceries

Assuming that W- spends an equal amount of time doing the same (we
often cook together, and he sometimes cooks during the week while I'm
fine with having leftovers), that comes to an average of 2 hours a day
related to preparing food -- usually a weekend afternoon, and
occasional weekday cooking.

What do we get for that?

- Yummy, healthy food (well, usually)
- Couple-time while planning our week, buying groceries, chopping ingredients, and preparing dishes; might save us expensive relationship therapy time later on
- Many of our favourite meals practically any day we want them (especially as the nearby restaurants don't make these meals or don't sell them for the same cost)
- The satisfaction of learning new skills and new recipes
- Shared experiences and memories

The replacement cost for our labour would probably be $15-25/hour,
which are the rates I see on Craigslist. Picking $20 as a reasonable
number and assuming optimistically that the person would be a drop-in
replacement, that's a replacement labour cost of ~$1,200 for the
privilege of having someone else shop for groceries, prepare food,
clean up. If we include the cost of materials and miscellaneous
expenses, that's around $8 a meal.

Let's look at selectively replacing parts of what we do. In a previous
analysis, I found my GroceryGateway bill was around 10% higher than
what it would have been at our neighbourhood supermarket, and in
addition, there's a $11.95 delivery fee. Assuming things worked out
perfectly and we could replace all our grocery shopping time (~11
hours a month), that would be like paying $85 to get 11 hours back, or
buying time at $8 an hour. Except it isn't really, because we'll still
walk two thirds of the way in order to get because we go to the
library.

If our time is valued at least at minimum wage for homeworkers in
Ontario ($11.28 / hour), then each meal has an labour cost of $3.64.
Add another $1 for utilities, cleaning supplies, and miscellaneous
costs, and that comes out to roughly $8 per meal (materials + labour +
production). This doesn't count the amortization of our investment in
knives, pans, and other tools.

- SCENARIO: Having our groceries delivered would save us 2
  person-hours, although we would then have to make a separate library
  trip: net gain 80-100 person-minutes, for a cost of roughly
  $21/week ($16/hour).

- SCENARIO: Having SupperSolved assemble and deliver the meals (/ (+
  304 45) (* 12 4.0)) - $7.27/meal, still needs cleanup; saves
  roughly 11 hours.

- SCENARIO: Making the meal at SupperSolved: 2 hours + 1 hour walk +
  $304 (/ 304 (* 12 4.0)) $6.33 plus time, still needs cleanup

I'm not always a cheerful, energetic ray of sunshine. Sometimes I feel
meh, too. Whether it's due to the disruption of routines or momentum,
frustration with uncertainty, or factors beyond my control, it
happens. During these doldrums, it's harder to work on creative tasks.
It's harder to move, even. There's the temptation to spend the time
browsing the Web or playing games instead--tempting activities that
don't require a lot of thinking and have a false sense of progress.

Instead of getting stuck in the doldrums--or pretending it doesn't
happen--I'd rather think about how I can hack my way around it.
Sometimes it's good to just relax into it, relying on the buffer from
good relationships and good finances. After all, I don't often give
myself permission to take a long afternoon nap, or read fiction, or
watch a movie. It can actually be quite satisfying to see things
chugging along even if I don't feel like I'm my usual self. We still
keep the house running smoothly, the financial markets still do well.
(I hope that if any "meh" periods coincide with market corrections,
I'll have the presence of mind to think, "Oh, stocks are on sale!")

Sometimes little things I do can dislodge me enough from the Sargasso
sea of suckitude. One of the things I find helpful is to think about
the difference between how this feels and other ways I've felt before.
Sure, I might feel meh at the moment, but there have also been moments
when I've felt awesome, accomplished, productive, energetic, and even
smug (in a good way =) ). Thinking about those different feelings
helps me remember that meh-ness is temporary, and it also helps me
figure out some things I can do that might move me closer to other
feelings. For example, I feel awesome when I learn interesting
technical things that help me save time or make tools. I feel
accomplished when I finish a large batch of cooking or I cross off
plenty of items on my TODO list. I feel energetic when I exercise and
when I solve problems. I feel an extra burst of smugness when I bike,
especially if it's been raining.

It can be hard to get over that activation threshold, though. Many
things that give me that positive buzz are creative in nature
(programming, writing, etc.). Fortunately, there are a few activities
that I can do even if my mind's wandering. Walking is a great use of
meh-brain time. I feel somewhat proud of myself because of the
exercise. I went for a 1.5-hour walk the other day, and that felt much
better than sitting at home playing video games. Tidying is another
good use of meh-time, and paperwork is like that too. I can practise
drawing, too - copying figures or slowly untangling my thoughts.

Writing this, I'm already starting to feel that usual sense of
"Actually, things are pretty awesome." =) I don't expect myself to be
100% on, and it makes no sense to beat myself up for not being on all
the time. But it's nice to know that the occasional "meh"-ness in my
life is temporary, and I can choose to either relax and enjoy it or
play around with some ways to nudge myself out of it.

"It must be nice

But my own favorite part of the book was in the description of the “Renaissance Man ideal”. This is the idea that you will have the most enjoyable life, AND the best chance at very early financial independence, by developing a whole load of interesting skills. The amazing part is that these skills don’t just sit independently in your mind like a bunch of unused kitchen appliances in a pantry. They start to reach out and connect to each other in unexpected ways, and start solving all of your problems for you. They build your curiosity and start sucking in still more skills that you can’t help acquiring. And before you know it, you are able to live a superb life on only a tiny fraction of the spending that a normal person does, even while you might end up accidentally earning money even more easily than before you embraced the Renaissance Ideal.

It’s been more than ten years since David Allen published Getting
Things Done. I still haven’t come up with a fully trustable system,
but Emacs + Org + Evernote is getting there. I’m glad I’m back to
using Org. I’m starting to run into the reminders I set for important
business paperwork last year, and I might have missed that if I was
relying on my memory or my calendar.

From time to time, when I catch myself feeling frazzled, I stop and
write down all of my open loops: the things that tug on my attention.
Some of them must be ruthlessly demoted to “someday/maybe,” or even
let go. And then I can methodically go through the others, crossing
them off as I finish them. Getting it all down on paper helps me make
sense of things and stops me from feeling overwhelmed.

I hardly ever finish projects. I start them with a burst of
enthusiasm, and then I trail off when something else catches my
attention. I've learned to work with this instead of beating myself up
about it. On some days, I might even consider it a good thing. Here's
one of the things I've learned:

*You can trick your brain by moving the goalposts.*

Let's say that you're working on a project. Toward the end of the
project, you catch yourself losing steam. You've gotten 80% of the way
there, and the remaining 20% of the work will take four times as much
time. The itch to start a different project is pulling you away.

Don't think of yourself as nearly done. Think of yourself as getting
started on another new project that just happens to overlap with the
previous one.

In fact, mentally set the beginning of that project to include some of
the work you've just completed, to take advantage of the [[http://io9.com/how-to-force-people-to-do-anything-and-have-them-thank-1648774440][Endowed
Progress effect]] ([[https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/jnunes/intellcont/Endowed%20Progress%20Effect-1.pdf][research PDF]]).

Tada! Goalposts moved. You might find that the newly-reframed project
is now novel enough to be included in the list of new projects you
enjoy working on, and it might even tempt you away from other
distractions.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts][Moving the goalposts]] is usually a bad thing. It's why many people
never feel rich, because whenever they reach what used to be
unimaginable wealth, they find that the amount of money needed for
them to feel happy has gone up. (Solution: don't anchor happiness to
amounts of money.) Moving the goalposts has led to many a logical
fallacy in heated arguments. But if you don't like playing a
close-quarters game, moving the goalposts further away can help.

I often use this technique for life-long learning, especially for
things that you can't really declare finished. Can one ever finish
learning how to write or draw or program? No, but you can keep moving
your targets a little forward as you learn.

You might think, "I won't be able to celebrate achieving my original
goal!" *You can still celebrate milestones.* Better yet, celebrate
even the tiny, tiny steps that you take towards your
(constantly-moving) goal. Look behind you once in a while and
celebrate the progress you've made.

It can be hard to see progress if you don't have anything tangible.
*Invest time in looking for useful chunks* that you can extract even
from work in progress. It's surprising how few projects are truly all
or nothing. If you can share drafts, prototypes, alpha or beta
versions, or even blog posts about the journey, you don't have to
worry about the whole thing being a complete waste of time if you get
distracted from the project before you finish it. If you always wait
until you've finished something, you might end up leaving [[http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/][a mess of
incomplete projects around]].

Worried that your mind will see through this technique and lose
interest even earlier in the process? Try being playful about it
instead of being too serious. Yes, it's a mental trick (and not even a
particularly complex one), but if your mind likes novelty and
beginnings, it can hardly fault you for giving it what it likes.

This technique doesn't solve everything - I haven't been able to write
a 200-page Emacs book yet, and our couch still doesn't have a
slipcover. But it helps me from time to time, and maybe it will help
you too!

It's not easy [[https://www.flickr.com/photos/sachac/16266462305][being on Windows]] instead of one of the more scriptable
operating systems out there, but I stay on it because I like the
drawing programs. Cygwin and Vagrant fill enough gaps to keep me
mostly sane. (Although maybe I should work up the courage to [[http://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2014/05/install-ubuntu-1404-alongside-windows.html][dual-boot Windows 8.1 and a Linux distribution]], and then get my [[http://virantha.com/2014/03/17/one-touch-scanning-with-fujitsu-scansnap-in-linux/][ScanSnap working]].)

Anyway, I'm making do. Thanks to [[http://nodejs.org/][Node]] and the abundance of libraries
available through NPM, Javascript is shaping up to be a surprisingly
useful scripting language.

After I used the Flickr API library for Javascript to [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/02/de-dupe-link-using-flickr-api-neaten-archive-link-sketches-blog-posts/][cross-reference
my Flickr archive with my blog posts]], I looked around for other things
I could do with it. [[http://webecoz.com/][photoSync]] occasionally didn't upload new pictures
I added to its folders (or at least, not as quickly as I wanted). I
wanted to replace photoSync with my own script that would:
- upload the picture only if it doesn't already exist,
- add tags based on the filename,
- add the photo to my Sketchbook photoset,
- move the photo to the "To blog" folder, and
- make it easy for me to refer to the Flickr image in my blog post or index.

The [[https://github.com/chbrown/flickr-with-uploads][flickr-with-uploads]] library made it easy to upload images and
retrieve information, although the format was slightly different from
the Flickr API library I used previously. (In retrospect, I should've
checked the [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/flickrapi][Flickr API]] documentation first - there's an example upload
request right on the main page. Oh well! Maybe I'll change it if I
feel like rewriting it.)

I searched my existing photos to see if a photo with that title
already existed. If it did, I displayed an Org-style list item with a
link. If it didn't exist, I uploaded it, set the tags, added the item
to the photo set, and moved it to the folder. Then I displayed an
Org-style link, but using a plus character instead of a minus
character. (Both + and - can be used for lists in Org.)

While using =console.log(...)= to display these links in the terminal
allowed me to mark and copy the link, I wanted to go one step further.
Could I send the links directly to Emacs? I looked into getting
=org-protocol= to work, but I was having problems figuring this out.
(I solved those problems; details later in this post.)

What were some other ways I could get the information into Emacs aside from copying and pasting from the terminal window? Maybe I could put text directly into the clipboard. The [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipboard][node-clipboard]] package didn't build for me and I couldn't get [[https://github.com/xavi-/node-copy-paste][node-copy-paste]] to work either,about the node-copy-paste README told me about the existence of the =clip= command-line utility, which worked for me.

On Windows, =clip= allows you to pipe the output of commands into your
clipboard. (There are similar programs for Linux or Mac OS X.) In
Node, you can start a child process and communicate with it through
pipes.

I got a little lost trying to figure out how to turn a string into a
streamable object that I could set as the new standard input for the
=clip= process I was going to spawn, but the solution turned out to be
much simpler than that. Just =write(...)= to the appropriate stream,
and call =end()= when you're done.

Here's the relevant bit of code that takes my =result= array and puts it into my clipboard:

#+begin_quote
    var child = cp.spawn('clip');
    child.stdin.write(result.join("\n"));
    child.stdin.end();
#+end_quote

Of course, to get to that point, I had to revise my script. Instead of
letting all the callbacks finish whenever they wanted, I needed to be
able to run some code after everything was done. I was a little
familiar with the =async= library, so I used that.

Wheeee! Hooray for automation. I made a Windows batch script like so:

up.bat
#+begin_src
node g:\code\node\flickr-upload.js %*
#+end_src

and away I went. Not only did I have a handy way to process images from the command line, I could also mark the files in Emacs Dired with =m=, then type =!= to execute my =up= command on the selected images. Mwahaha!

Anyway, I thought I'd write it up in case other people were curious
about using Node to code little utilities, filling the clipboard in
Windows, or getting data back into Emacs (sometimes the clipboard is
enough).

Back to =org-protocol=, since I was curious about it. With =(require 'org-protocol) (server-start)=, =emacsclient
org-protocol://store-link:/foo/bar= worked when I entered it at the
command prompt. I was having a hard time getting it to work under
Node, but eventually I figured out that:
- I needed to pass =-n= as one of the arguments to =emacsclient= so
  that it would return right away.
- The =:= after =store-link= is important! I was passing
  =org-protocol://store-link/foo/bar= and wondering why it opened up a
  file called =bar=. =org-protocol://store-link:/foo/bar= was what I
  needed.

I only just figured out that last bit while writing this post.
Here's a small demonstration program:

#+begin_src js2
var cp = require('child_process');
var child = cp.execFile('emacsclient', ['-n', 'org-protocol://store-link:/foo/bar']);
#+end_src

Yay!

For practice, I converted the QUnit tests to Jasmine. The first part of the test was easy, but I wanted a clean way to do the HTML fixture-based tests for prettydate.update too.
[[https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery][Jasmine-JQuery]] gives you a handy way to have HTML fixtures. Here's what my code ended up as:

=spec/DateSpec.js=
#+begin_src js2
describe("PrettyDate.format", function() {
    function checkDate(name, then, expected) {
        it(name, function() {
            expect(prettyDate.format('2008/01/28 22:25:00Z', then)).toEqual(expected);
        });
    }
    checkDate("should display recent times", '2008/01/28 22:24:30Z', 'just now');
    checkDate("should display times within a minute", '2008/01/28 22:23:30Z', '1 minute ago');
    checkDate("should display times within an hour", '2008/01/28 21:23:30Z', '1 hour ago');
    checkDate("should display times within a day", '2008/01/27 22:23:30Z', 'Yesterday');
    checkDate("should display times within two days", '2008/01/26 22:23:30Z', '2 days ago');
});
describe("PrettyDate.update", function() {
    function domtest(name, now, first, second) {
       it(name, function() {
           loadFixtures('test_fixture.html');
           var links = document.getElementById('qunit-fixture').getElementsByTagName('a');
           expect(links[0].innerHTML).toEqual('January 28th, 2008');
           expect(links[2].innerHTML).toEqual('January 27th, 2008');
           prettyDate.update(now);
           expect(links[0].innerHTML).toEqual(first);
           expect(links[2].innerHTML).toEqual(second);
       });
    }
    domtest("prettyDate.update", '2008-01-28T22:25:00Z', '2 hours ago', 'Yesterday');
    domtest("prettyDate.update, one day later", '2008-01-29T22:25:00Z', 'Yesterday', '2 days ago');
});

Imagine I have amazing assistants and a smoothly-running team. What am I doing with those capabilities?

2 days a week, I'm focused on talking to people. I'm booked efficiently; tea, lunch, tea, second tea. Some of these meetings involve walks instead of food. The meetings cluster in various locations in order to minimize travel time. I might have one day for face-to-face meetings and one day for virtual meetings.

After each meeting, I have at least half an hour to define next actions and get the ball rolling. It's easy to prioritize based on time and importance. We get the first actions out right away, impressing people, and then we follow up with depth. My assistant fills in the time with other tasks from the next actions list. I have at least 20 hours of work for people, so it's easy for them to focus.

Types of things I delegate:
Scheduling - I forward them emails and get back neatly formatted calendar entries
Email response handling - they read my mail, prioritize, send me action items, and work on tasks.
Web research - I send them questions and get back summaries of the top ten resources I should read. I suggest search queries, and they add their own.
Illustration - I have backup illustrators who can sketchnote things that I can't get to, or who can share different styles and metaphors.
Development - When I have an idea about Rails or Wordpress, I can work with someone to make it happen.
Web design - themes, tweaks, beautifully HTMLized pages...
Copywriting and copyediting - I send things over and get polished, engaging content
Calls - Assistants can take care of calling businesses when they're open and following up if needed, such as when setting appointments or making reservations.
Layout - I share a Dropbox folder with a bunch of graphics or documents. The assistant lays things out so that they're well-balanced in terms of whitespace and size.
Transcription - I save webinars and interviews (or set people up to record) into a Dropbox shared folder, and I send an email. I get a well-formatted blog post or document with the cleaned-up transcript.
Outlining and writing - someone helps me brainstorm blog post topics and outlines, fleshing them out with research, and organizing the topics into books
Video - editing, synchronizing sound, adding transitions, etc.
...

I also have recurring tasks for projects and initiatives I care about. Things just work smoothly. I get confirmations.

I have this lovely web-based process manual and a visual overview of tasks.

I'm always collecting people for my pipeline.
Hiring is not stressful - I have good onboarding and offboarding
processes. I hire shortly before I really need to, so that I can ramp
up people.

** Learning from how other people delegate
** Is your podcast a good fit for sketchnotes?

Do you produce "evergreen" content that people regularly want to refer to? You'll get lasting value from sketchnotes about topics that are perennially interesting or useful, while time-sensitive or news updates have limited benefits.

Do you have a large, social-media savvy audience in terms of blog readers, website visitors, or social media followers? Sketchnotes can help you convert them to podcast listeners or get them to check out a specific podcast. It can also get more value out of other resources such as blog posts and e-books. Newsletter subscribers and podcast subscribers don't get as much immediate value from sketchnotes because they don't see them right away. If you're active on Twitter or Facebook, you'll be able to get more value out of the sketchnotes because of embedded images in the news stream as well as RTs and CCs.

Is your podcast a source of revenue? What kind of business benefit do you anticipate? What kinds of increases in readership or other benefits would you consider worth different levels of investment (knowing there's no such thing as a guarantee... =) )? Sketching an episode that already has an edited transcript can be more cost-effective, because transcripts allow the sketchnote artist can get an quick overview of the podcast's structure and confirm the spelling of important words.

    - Lots of blog readers, website visitors, or social media followers - sketchnotes can help you convert them to podcast listeners or reach out to their networks for new audiences. Newsletter subscribers get limited benefits as well.
    - You provide information that people regularly refer to. Sketchnotes are great for printing out and keeping as "cheat sheets."
    - Your podcast is sponsored or is a major contributor to your business marketing or outreach.

** I like being introverted  :snippets:

Sometimes people tell me that they can’t believe I’m introverted. You
organize meetups, they say. You share a lot online. You can’t possibly
be introverted. Not only do I need to recharge after conferences or
other intense social interactions, I like being introverted – it’s
good to be comfortable with yourself. That said, you learn a lot when
you bump into other people, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to
have more of those serendipitous conversations.

I like group conversations more than one-on-ones because I get to
learn from the intersections of people’s interests. I see different
aspects of people than I might bring out on my own. Group
conversations also reduce the pressure to carry the conversation
myself – people bring their own questions and tips and ideas to the
table.

I’m particularly interested in virtual meetups because there are so
many wonderful people out there whom I will probably never be in the
same city with. Toronto is a great meetup city because there’s always
something going on, but there’s no reason why knowledge-sharing should
be unnecessarily privileged or limited by geographic proximity. If
people are curious about blogging, drawing, Emacs, Quantified Self, or
whatever we have in common, maybe we can have virtual show-and-tells
instead of relying on the probability of finding critical mass for a
meetup in our own areas.

---
I get my energy from a quiet and simple life. I’ve learned to say no
when I need more space: no if I need quiet instead of networking (even
if there could be someone who could change my life or vice versa just
over there); no if I need silence instead of a taxi cab conversation;
no to people’s requests in favour of spending time with W- or on my
own projects.

It’s hard to learn how to say no, or even to learn that you can. “Say
yes to everything,” the advice goes. Seize the day. Grab those
opportunities.

But there’s a lot of power in being able to listen to your needs and
carve out the time and space that you need—to meet the world on your
own terms, and to be happy to give because you’re ready to do so.

** Hacking my way into meeting people
I try to minimize the number of things I’ve promised to other people
so that I have the flexibility to follow opportunities when they come
up. Conversations are an exception. It’s hard to not schedule those if
I want to make sure they happen at some point. Left to my own devices,
I might never get around to talking to people. So I pay someone a
small amount to handle my scheduling, which neatly removes me from the
back-and-forth hassles of coordinating times and also (useful and
possibly more important!) prevents me from giving myself excuses not
to do it. Then I remind myself that getting to and from these
appointments is either reading time or free exercise (for in-person
meetings), or possible podcast or blog material (if online). Introvert
hack. =)

One of the advantages of setting up Wordpress on my own server ([[http://sachachua.com/blog/2011/10/decision-review-switching-from-rackspace-cloud-to-linode/][I use Linode at $30/month]]) is the ability to add plugins that make my blogging life easier. Each plugin takes a little bit of extra memory, but I think they're worth it. Here are 31 of the plugins I use on my blog at http://sachachua.com .

- Organization
    - [[http://stresslimitdesign.com/editorial-calendar-plugin][WordPress Editorial Calendar]] :: Awesome way to see what I've got scheduled for when, and drag-and-drop interface for rescheduling posts

- Security
    - [[http://bit51.com/software/better-wp-security/][Better WP Security]] :: Because a compromised blog sucks.
    - [[http://www.wordfence.com/][Wordfence Security]] :: Security, of course
- Discovery
    - [[http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/llbbsc/wpOTD][On This Day]] :: Because I've got more than ten years of posts and it's interesting to look back into the past
    - [[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-popular-posts][Wordpress Popular Posts]] :: Because data
    - [[http://rmarsh.com/plugins/post-plugin-library/][Post-Plugin Library]] :: Needed by the Similar Posts plugin
    - [[http://rmarsh.com/plugins/similar-posts/][Similar Posts]] :: Suggestions
- Categories and tags
    - [[http://scribu.net/wordpress/term-management-tools][Term Management Tools]] :: Rein in your categories and tags
    - [[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/uncategorized/][Categorized]] :: Gets rid of "Uncategorized" when I actually pick a category. Handy when I was reorganizing.
    - [[http://www.billerickson.net/shortcode-to-display-posts/][Display Posts Shortcode]] :: Lets me easily list posts from a category or tag
    - [[http://wp-types.com/][WP Views]] :: Flexible system for creating lists of things (paid plugin)

- Stats
    - [[http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/help/wordpress_quickstart][FeedBurner FeedSmith]] :: Because stats are helpful
    - [[http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/#utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wpgaplugin&utm_content=v420][Google Analytics for Wordpress]] :: Because stats are helpful
- Other conveniences
    - [[http://status301.net/wordpress-plugins/highlight-search-terms][Highlight Search Terms]] :: Making life easier for searchers
    - [[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/][Jetpack by WordPress.com]] :: A behemoth of a plugin, but the subscriptions are easier for people
    - [[http://pn.xn--strbe-mva.de/][Post Notification]] :: I used to use this for e-mail subscriptions and I haven't moved everyone over to Feedburner yet, so I keep it around
    - [[http://yoast.com/wordpress/rss-footer/][RSS Footer]] :: Add links to my scraped content
    - [[http://lesterchan.net/portfolio/programming/php/][WP-Polls]] :: This makes it easy to ask quick questions, which I should do more of
    - [[http://www.kreci.net/code/wordpress/subscribers-text-counter-widget/][Subscribers Text Counter]] :: Social proof without dealing with visually-conflicting widgets
    - [[http://slangji.wordpress.com/wp-missed-schedule/][WP Missed Schedule]] :: Helps guard against missed schedule posts. Still happens, though
- A patched version of Auto Featured Image :: I changed this to pick the largest image
- Sacha Chua's fixes :: Little tweaks to make my blogging life easier, such as adding Share a Draft and Redirection to my post editing screen

Every so often, I go through my list and remove plugins I don't use as much in order to reduce memory use and improve security. Still, with thousands of plugins available on http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins, there are always more ways to make blogs better. (Come to think of it, I should probably add a SEO-focused plugin too. [[http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/][WordPress SEO by Yoast]] seems popular...) Hope this list of favourites helps!

It's getting cooler here in Toronto, with possible snow showers and
scattered flurries this weekend. Time to think about how I can make
this winter even better!

The Scott Quest Vest is working out really well, allowing me to leave
my belt bag behind. I haven't quite gotten the hang of all the
pockets, but I can generally find the most frequent things I use. One
of the earphone loops has worked loose and gotten frayed by nearby
Velcro, though. I'll check with the manufacturer, since I haven't
figured out how to securely hand-sew elastic loops like that.

I've started wearing my thermals again. With that, the vest, and maybe
a sweater, I'm pretty okay with the 5-10C temperatures these days. A
rain jacket is handy, too. A hoodie and maybe gloves will take me down
to 3C or so.

Here are some notes I put together while thinking about what kind of coat I wanted to get this year:

#+ATTR_HTML: width="640"
[[../../Inbox/To blog/2014-10-11 Considering winter coats.png]]

I ended up deciding on a waterproof jacket with an interchangable
lining that's compatible with a down jacket. I'm still keeping an eye
out for a large, warm hat, but I can probably get by with a nice warm
scarf and my winter hats. It turns out that I'm somewhat picky about
hats, so I haven't quite found the one I like the most yet.

The new office my clients have moved to is directly connected to the
PATH, so my winter exposure during consulting days will just be the
10-20 minute walk to the subway station. I plan to be at Hacklab more
often, though, so that will still involve a bit of waiting. The new
Hacklab has nicely vivid accent colours, so I'll probably head over
there if I feel colour-deprived.


I probably need to get new winter boots. I noticed last year that my
insulated boots were no longer waterproof. The shoe stores don't seem
to have brought in their winter boot selections yet, but I'll check
again in a few months. I tried looking for winter boots at
end-of-season sales earlier this year, but since I have small feet and
a preference for simple styles, the sizes tend to be sold out quickly.
I had the same problem with coats, too, which is why I decided to get
a new coat early in the season instead of waiting to see what the rest
of the options were.

Compared to last year, I'm even more comfortable with cooking and
baking, and I'm looking forward to keeping the house warm and the
fridge full.

Bring it on!

** CANCELLED Gardening and learning to see the small differences
I'm in the garden every other day, sometimes more often. I pull weeds, test the soil, water the plants. I'm paying closer attention this year, trying to learn the differences, trying to get a sense of things growing (as slow as they do). 
** New Game+
I recently finished playing The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. I started on September 4 and finished on October 2. I logged 41.5 hours playing it as my primary activity, and probably another 25 hours playing while on the subway or while waiting for something else.

I've been feeling less social these days. I don't know what my energy levels will be like, so it's hard to make social commitments.

I patched a big pinch flat in my front tire yesterday. Apparently not
well enough, or maybe there's another leak (even though I checked the
tire with water). The bike was flat again this morning. Ah well. I can
write just as well from home as I can from Hacklab or other places.
Besides, there are several libraries nearby if I want airconditioning
and ambient noise.

The etymology for the Dutch word for bicycle (/fiets/) apparently has
something to do with it being a "substitute horse" (source: Dutch
friend, although [[http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/week-sci-ed-29022012][this]] says something similar too). I think about that
every time I maintain my bike. It amuses me to think of this as taking
care of my substitute horse, minus expenses of feed and livery and the
chores of mucking things out. It's also a darn sight cheaper than car
insurance, not to mention gas.

I bought this bicycle in 2009. Since then, I've saved more than its
cost in public transit tokens.




** Amping up this homebody lifestyle

W- and I are both homebodies. We like spending time at home instead of
going out to eat, shop, or be entertained, although we do go out
occasionally. There's so much to try and learn and do even at home,
though. We're nowhere near the limits of what's possible.

If I'm more inclined towards the homebody lifestyle by nature, how can
I make the most of it? What would an amazing homebody life be like for
us?

*Shelter:* I've been helping with more of the household maintenance tasks. That way, W- can have more free time in the future, and I can pick up some practical skills. I'd like to work on my fitness a bit more (maybe make good progress on the introductory rungs of the Hacker's Diet exercise ladder), and then maybe I'll try volunteering with Habitat for Humanity in order to pick up more DIY skills there too.

We finally moved our Adirondack chairs ([[http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/06/the-fruits-and-chairs-of-our-labour/][the ones we made ourselves!]] =) ) out of the shed and onto the deck. I think I'll enjoy dinners on the deck, and maybe some reading and drawing out there as well. Plenty of light, and the chairs are wonderfully comfortable.

*Food:* We're pretty happy with our cooking repertoire, but it would be good to learn more recipes and to get even better at preparing the ones we know. I made gazpacho recently (super-easy with the food processor!) and that was perfect for the summer heat. If I look into more vegetable-focused dishes, I can use those recipes for Hacklab open houses too.

In terms of cooking,

*Reading:* I can start by reading all the books in the house, since W- has quite a few that I haven't even opened. I also have quite a few books that I haven't taken detailed notes on yet. Then I can pick one of those "Books You Should Read" lists and go through them all. In some fields, I'm starting to get a sense of the conversation that happens among authors, and I like that.

** OUTLINED No good or bad, just different
- Canada Post lost the passport that was sent through Xpresspost, so
  I need to go through the process of filing for a lost passport:
  official statement, police report, affidavit of
  loss, a rather high lost passport replacement fee, and another
  two months of waiting.

- I was not happy to find out they had lost my passport. I pouted and
  indulged in getting a few hugs from W-, who happened to be working
  from home at the time.

- Cheering up, I said, "I've never lost a passport before. Well, at
  least I get to learn how the process works!" I started singing,
  "Always look on the bright side of life..."

- "Okay, that's a bit of a stretch," W- said. But I think he was
  happy that I could bounce back easily. I know I was.

- Here is something I'm starting to learn about life: situations
  aren't bad or good, they're just different.

- Different is okay. I can deal with different.

- There's always something to be thankful for and something to learn
  from. In this case, I'm glad that we didn't book an August trip
  that we would have to cancel, and I'm glad that we have the space
  to deal with issues like this.

- There will be bigger challenges than this, so this is good
  preparation.

When I project my current paths out to their peaks, I learn a lot about where I want to go and how I want to get there. For example, I'm currently learning about sales by selling sketchnoting services. I'm starting with that because it's relatively easy to appreciate (yay visuals!), there are established companies in other geographies that have tested the business model and value proposition, and people want it. There's a lot of room to grow. If I imagine being a super-sketchnoter or a super-illustrator, though, I feel like there's something missing. I feel like the focus is on interpreting someone else's ideas instead of creating something marvelous and new. Artists create new things, and there's something fascinating in that.

I like making contingency plans. It's like peeking up a manifold of
possibilities, imagining a sure-footed Sacha capably dealing with
whatever comes down the pipe.

In preparation for a recent event, I made a list of different things
that could go wrong, highlighting specific scenarios I needed to worry
about and listing a few catch-all scenarios as well. Amusingly enough,
the actual challenges that came up (Windows updates, network/hardware
latency, a network configuration reset, Powerpoint crashes,
last-minute changes) weren't on my list as specific scenarios, but
they were addressed by our general back-up plans. I like the blend of
specific and general. Specific scenarios help you flush out questions
to ask and things to prepare, while general scenarios identify
characteristics to prepare for and help you come up with flexible
strategies. Both types help you minimize stress when things do happen.
Knowing that you have a backup plan, what the trade-offs are, and a
probable deadline for committing to that plan helps you worry less
about catastrophic failure and lets you focus on coming up with a
better ad-hoc option.

One of the things that I gained a better appreciation of was the
trade-off between preparing in advance and waiting until you can test
your hypotheses. For example, I wasn't sure if the server would be
able to accept incoming connections once at the venue. I could adapt
the code to run on my public webserver, but that would take a little
time. However, since we were likely to be able to get things to work
on the event network, I could postpone worrying about it to Sunday,
which meant that I could spend Saturday doing non-work things instead.

Outside work, I also have a lot of scenarios and contingency plans.
It's been interesting slowly moving through time, watching the
different uncertainties resolve themselves. Doors close and new
possibilities open up. Because I've scanned my personal notes and I've
blogged about many of my projections, I can recall a little bit of
what past-Sacha was thinking, standing on the threshold of the
unknown. I tend to overestimate risks and costs, but I'm good at
coming up with small tests and approaches. I'm good at tracking my
progress and keeping an eye out for "trip lines," little reminders to
myself to re-evaluate the situation. I want to get better at
generating more general scenarios and alternative approaches, and
properly evaluating risk/reward (maybe calibrating these with other
people's experiences). It's fun treating life as a Choose Your Own
Adventure where you might be able to peek ahead a little! =)

* E-mail newsletter
** Welcome (day after sign-up)

Thanks for signing up! I'm looking forward to sharing the things I've learned and to learning from you along the way. There's a lot of stuff on my blog, but I thought I'd start with an introduction:

*Hi, I'm Sacha Chua, and I'm interested in lots of things.*

It's a little weird to not have one of those "I'm a <job title goes here>" introductions, but I'm starting to get used to it. I'm in the middle of a 5-year experiment with semi-retirement, which is really an excuse for me to learn more about entrepreneurship, consulting, writing, drawing, coding, and all those other things that were hard to squeeze into evenings and weekends back in my corporate life. (I had really liked working with a big company and an excellent team, but I wanted to learn these other things too.)

I started this blog when I was in university as a way of taking notes and sharing what I was learning. It turned out to be a great way to learn from other people too. I hope it will help you, and I'm looking forward to discovering what we can learn together.

*What can you expect from me?*

You'll get weekly blog updates with links to the posts I've read in the past week and some interesting things I learned about elsewhere on the Internet.
I post on my main blog daily, which can be a little overwhelming for people. But if you're an e-mail ninja or a feed reader fan, you can subscribe to the daily feed at http://feeds.sachachua.com/sachac .

Over the next few weeks, I'll also be sending you a few e-mails to help you find out about things you might like in my past posts. I might also write with the occasional question that I want to pick people's brains on before I write blog posts, maybe even with sneak previews of what I've been learning.

*Some stuff worth reading*

If you're new to my blog, you might want to check out some of my older posts.
Here are some of the most popular ones.

** How can you design a good "Help and Support" page?

Design seems like magic, but it's probably a skill that I can develop. If I just focus on coding, the things I build can end up looking like an accumulation of little ideas designed by committee. If I learn more about design and develop my own opinions, I can make recommendations that simplify the experience and make it more coherent. For example, on one of my consulting engagements, I could probably take the initiative in redesigning the help and support community for a better user experience. I have to work with the technical limitations of the platform, but as a coder, I have a little more latitude than most people do. By looking at how other people have structured their support experiences, maybe I can pick up ideas that I can try.



What are the key ingredients?
- Tutorials for new users
  - Not just how, but why
- Other self-help resources for intermediate and advanced users
- Questions and answers for people who can't find what they need
- Quick links and resources for the support team

** Long-lasting
*I stuff as much as possible into my blog* - it seems to have the only
notes that last. I have a shelf full of half-used paper notebooks.
I've lost text files with notes on hard drives that have long since
vanished. I've encrypted messages to myself and, years later,
discovered I hadn't kept the key around. (Duh.) My blog has my most
long-lived notes, having survived several transfers between blog hosts
and a few backups. I've probably gotten the hang of this "blog backup
and migration" thing, and I trust it more than I trust third-party
services like Evernote.
