#+TITLE: Sharing Outline
This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!

  don't have to work again"?
  - Writing, drawing, coding based on my own interests
  - Sharing as much as possible
  - Open to receiving payment from other people as a way of funding
    more experiments - maybe tie value directly to experiments in a
    micro-Kickstarter sort of way?

- Next theme: Emotions
- Survey
** OUTLINED Thinking about a virtual meetup for sketchnoters    
- Kevin Dulle organizing tweetchats
- It would be great to go over different techniques
- Finding speakers is always a challenge
- But it's a great learning experience, so even if I sketch out a
  "curriculum" and prepare many of the talks, that's fine. 
- Also, people can always step forward and volunteer.
- Next steps:
  - Experiment with Google Hangout
** Not about drawing better

Not better drawing

better use of what I draw

better inspiration for others

** Planning a sketch on index cards
** Building your visual vocabulary
** Printing sketchnotes
I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.

Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a

I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.

Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder...

** How to listen and draw at the same time

How to listen and draw at the same time


When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!

* Self-tracking
** Data visualization
*** Visualizing hierarchical data
- What questions do you want to ask?
  - How do the categories compare with each other?
  - Within the categories, how do things break down?
  - And then within that, I'm curious - how does it shift and change
    over time?

- Immediate benefits of time-tracking
  - Hawthorne effect
  - Focus
  - Impulse
** Quantified Time: Consulting Days vs. Open Days
Does work really get in the way of living?
** How does tracking affect your happiness?
** Time-tracking workshop
*** Session 1: The Whys and Hows of Tracking Time
Discuss objectives and motivations for tracking time. Plan possible questions you want to ask of the data (which influences which tools to try and how to collect data). Recommend a set of tools based on people’s interests and context (paper? iPhone? Android? Google Calendar?).
Resources: Presentations on time-tracking, recommendations for tools, more detail on structuring data (categories, fields); possible e-mail campaign for reminders
Output: Planning worksheet for participants to help people remember their motivations and structure their data collection; habit triggers for focused, small-scale data collection, buddying up for people who prefer social accountability
*** Session 2: Staying on the Wagon + Preliminary Analysis
Checking in to see if people are tracking time the way they want to. Online and/or one-on-one check-ins before the workshop date, plus a group session on identifying and dealing with obstacles (because it helps to know that other people struggle and overcome these things). Preliminary analysis of small-scale data.
Resources: Frequently-encountered challenges and how to deal with them; resources on habit design; tool alternatives
Output: Things to try in order to support habit change; larger-scale data collection for people who are doing well
*** Session 3: Analyzing your data
Massaging your data to fit a common format; simple analyses and interpretation
Resources: Common analysis format and some sample charts/instructions; maybe even a web service?
Output: Yay, charts!
*** Session 4: More ways you can slice and dice your data
Bring other questions you’d like to ask, and we’ll show you how to extract that out of your data (if possible – and if not, what else you’ll probably need to collect going forward). Also, understanding and using basic statistics
Resources: Basic statistics, uncommon charts
Output: More analyses!
*** Session 5: Making data part of the way you live
Building a personal dashboard, integrating your time data into your decisions
Outcome: Be able to make day-to-day decisions using your time data; become comfortable doing ad-hoc queries to find out more
*** Session 6: Designing your own experiments
Designing experiments and measuring interventions (A/B/A, how to do a blind study on yourself)
Outcome: A plan for changing one thing and measuring the impact on time
*** Session 7: Recap, Show & Tell
Participants probably have half a year of data and a personal experiment or two – hooray! Share thoughts and stories, inspire each other, and figure out what the next steps look like.

Stephanie Diamond suggested making a sketchnotes course on Udemy.
People have asked me about teaching Emacs, or blogging, or Quantified
Self tracking and analysis.

- What would you want to learn for free?
- What would you value at $49?
- What would you value at $99?

Help me figure out a good curriculum that could help you!

** It's okay to be wrong
At an applied rationality meetup in Toronto, the guest speaker
confessed to being afraid of blogging because she didn't want to be
pinned down to words. 

People think of writing as final. The fuzziness of conversation in
memory might let you argue, "That's not what I said," but writing
leaves you no wiggle room. 

It's okay to be wrong.

- What people are afraid of
  - Not being able to adjust
  - Misunderstandings
  - Unexpected audience
- Being wrong
  - Inevitable
  - Story about class
  - Story about blog
  - Story about comics
  - Keeps me honest
- Going forward
  - Not an expert
  - Conversation
  - Modeling it

** What I like writing about
** Writing everywhere
** Collecting stories and quotes
** Improving my writing system
** The power of long lists
** Organizing what I know
** Flipping through my notes
** Getting the hang of passing everything through Evernote
** E-book tips
** Embracing the resistance in terms of writing
The resistance is a symptom that you're on the right track. /The
resistance is not something to be avoided; it's something to seek
out./ ... The artist sees out the feeling of the resistance and then
tries to maximize it. The cog, the day laborer, the compliant
student--they seek to eliminate the feeling instead.

** Imagining wild success: delegation   :imagine:
Imagine I have amazing assistants and a smoothly-running team. What am I doing with those capabilities?

2 days a week, I'm focused on talking to people. I'm booked efficiently; tea, lunch, tea, second tea. Some of these meetings involve walks instead of food. The meetings cluster in various locations in order to minimize travel time. I might have one day for face-to-face meetings and one day for virtual meetings.

After each meeting, I have at least half an hour to define next actions and get the ball rolling. It's easy to prioritize based on time and importance. We get the first actions out right away, impressing people, and then we follow up with depth. My assistant fills in the time with other tasks from the next actions list. I have at least 20 hours of work for people, so it's easy for them to focus.

Types of things I delegate:
Scheduling - I forward them emails and get back neatly formatted calendar entries
Email response handling - they read my mail, prioritize, send me action items, and work on tasks.
Web research - I send them questions and get back summaries of the top ten resources I should read. I suggest search queries, and they add their own.
Illustration - I have backup illustrators who can sketchnote things that I can't get to, or who can share different styles and metaphors.
Development - When I have an idea about Rails or Wordpress, I can work with someone to make it happen.
Web design - themes, tweaks, beautifully HTMLized pages...
Copywriting and copyediting - I send things over and get polished, engaging content
Calls - Assistants can take care of calling businesses when they're open and following up if needed, such as when setting appointments or making reservations.
Layout - I share a Dropbox folder with a bunch of graphics or documents. The assistant lays things out so that they're well-balanced in terms of whitespace and size.
Transcription - I save webinars and interviews (or set people up to record) into a Dropbox shared folder, and I send an email. I get a well-formatted blog post or document with the cleaned-up transcript.
Outlining and writing - someone helps me brainstorm blog post topics and outlines, fleshing them out with research, and organizing the topics into books
Video - editing, synchronizing sound, adding transitions, etc.
...

I also have recurring tasks for projects and initiatives I care about. Things just work smoothly. I get confirmations.

I have this lovely web-based process manual and a visual overview of tasks.

I'm always collecting people for my pipeline.
Hiring is not stressful - I have good onboarding and offboarding
processes. I hire shortly before I really need to, so that I can ramp
up people.

** What would you do with more money?  :link:
One of the downsides of building a really good frugality muscle (that reflexive reaction of "Oh, I don't really need this, do I?") is that

I’ve been reading through Mr. Money Mustache’s blog archive, and his blog post on What would you do with WAY MORE money? made me think about what I value and what I would change. Like him, I’m comfortable with the way things are. I like eating at home. I like getting books and movies from the library instead of buying them. (No storage or waste issues, wide selection, and the satisfaction of boosting library circulation statistics…) I like my hobbies and interests. I like my freedom from the endless hedonic treadmill.
Not even the latest apps or gadgets, aside from the occasional experiment. (Shh! I hope they don’t take away my geek card. ;) )
About the only thing that would be awesomer would be to make more frequent trips to the Philippines (maybe every year! or on a whim!) or to join family and friends on their vacations. Although that’s constrained by other things too, like the fact that I like spending time with W- and he needs to be here in Toronto for J-.

** Living an off-peak life  :link:

It’s finally spring in full force, and I’ve been biking whenever I can get away with it. The bike ride is a little faster than the subway commute to my client, and I like not have to squeeze into the crowded train. Free exercise along a well-maintained trail with plenty of flowers and trees…

** Substituting pleasures
It’s been easier and easier to substitute pleasures. A $12 bowl of pho is yummy, but a $2 banh mi sandwich will do just fine. Why buy a DVD (even a used one) if there are so many unwatched ones at the library? I have clothes I haven’t worn in ages.
** Managing my personal and business finances
** Time and gadget tradeoffs
** What's worth spending on?
I'd been contemplating this question for the past four years.

What's worth spending on? I invest for the future, save for unexpected expenses, and support causes and people - but it's good to have that discretionary part of my budget which I can use to enjoy life and learn how to make better decisions.

Many people care about stuff. I apporeciate that. There are many examples of things that have enabled me to enjoy and learn from life so much more, such as my tablet PC.

Many people care about experiences. I appreciate that, too. I like how experiences can lead to deeper relationships.

Many people know something else that I'm just beginning to figure out. You can spend on people, on time, on making things happen. This is awesome! There's a candy store of talent out there - a world full of people with unique experiences, skills, and passions.

Like the way I've learned about what works well for me in terms of
spending on stuff and experiences, I want to learn how to spend on
making things happen. And who knows? If I can get good enough at it,
maybe I can learn how to create so much value that it becomes a
self-perpetuating machine.

** It's about time

(personal motivation)
More than anything, I wanted time. Ever since I was a kid, I had
always been acutely aware of how short a time we actually have. (Can I
blame this on reading about Raistlin's hourglass eyes in Dragonlance,
which I suppose was my first introduction to Stoic negative
visualization?) Being halfway around the world from family is hard
enough. I see the time pass for my parents in their Facebook pictures
and on our Skype calls. As for here, W- is much older than I am, and I
want to make the most of the time that I have with him.

** Not optimizing for productivity

One of the people I was chatting with was interested in measuring
productivity. As I started thinking about it, I realized that I care
about making sure I’m not breaking many promises. Sometimes I slip up,
and then I know I have to slow down and take my time. I’m curious
about some things that might improve my effectiveness (dictation or
podcasting for these posts, to make the words flow better? automated
tests for my coding? visual vocabularies for my drawing?), but they
tend to be more qualitative than...

** Rediscovering the renaissance life :link:
"It must be nice

But my own favorite part of the book was in the description of the “Renaissance Man ideal”. This is the idea that you will have the most enjoyable life, AND the best chance at very early financial independence, by developing a whole load of interesting skills. The amazing part is that these skills don’t just sit independently in your mind like a bunch of unused kitchen appliances in a pantry. They start to reach out and connect to each other in unexpected ways, and start solving all of your problems for you. They build your curiosity and start sucking in still more skills that you can’t help acquiring. And before you know it, you are able to live a superb life on only a tiny fraction of the spending that a normal person does, even while you might end up accidentally earning money even more easily than before you embraced the Renaissance Ideal.

** Open loops :link:

It’s been more than ten years since David Allen published Getting
Things Done. I still haven’t come up with a fully trustable system,
but Emacs + Org + Evernote is getting there. I’m glad I’m back to
using Org. I’m starting to run into the reminders I set for important
business paperwork last year, and I might have missed that if I was
relying on my memory or my calendar.

From time to time, when I catch myself feeling frazzled, I stop and
write down all of my open loops: the things that tug on my attention.
Some of them must be ruthlessly demoted to “someday/maybe,” or even
let go. And then I can methodically go through the others, crossing
them off as I finish them. Getting it all down on paper helps me make
sense of things and stops me from feeling overwhelmed.

** Tool talk: Clipboard managers
Clipboard managers

Ditto - want more of a collection view
ClipMate - does not keep transparent backgrounds, but otherwise interesting collection management. Fixed transparency by enabling DIB and TIFF! Okay, we're good to go.

Decision criteria:
- must be able to organize clips into collections that don't get buried under new clips (can select collection)
- pen-friendly
- always-on-top


Stuf: transparent, good previous, but doesn't seem to have an always-on-top view

Clipboard Master: not transparent

Clipboard Fusion - can't handle images, I think

Try ClipMate because of the interface for selecting clips

Intended uses:
- Text for filenames
- Clipped images for pasting into a layer; not transparent, so darken only?

** Getting better at learning from online courses
* Connecting
** I like being introverted  :snippets:

Sometimes people tell me that they can’t believe I’m introverted. You
organize meetups, they say. You share a lot online. You can’t possibly
be introverted. Not only do I need to recharge after conferences or
other intense social interactions, I like being introverted – it’s
good to be comfortable with yourself. That said, you learn a lot when
you bump into other people, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to
have more of those serendipitous conversations.

I like group conversations more than one-on-ones because I get to
learn from the intersections of people’s interests. I see different
aspects of people than I might bring out on my own. Group
conversations also reduce the pressure to carry the conversation
myself – people bring their own questions and tips and ideas to the
table.

I’m particularly interested in virtual meetups because there are so
many wonderful people out there whom I will probably never be in the
same city with. Toronto is a great meetup city because there’s always
something going on, but there’s no reason why knowledge-sharing should
be unnecessarily privileged or limited by geographic proximity. If
people are curious about blogging, drawing, Emacs, Quantified Self, or
whatever we have in common, maybe we can have virtual show-and-tells
instead of relying on the probability of finding critical mass for a
meetup in our own areas.

---
I get my energy from a quiet and simple life. I’ve learned to say no
when I need more space: no if I need quiet instead of networking (even
if there could be someone who could change my life or vice versa just
over there); no if I need silence instead of a taxi cab conversation;
no to people’s requests in favour of spending time with W- or on my
own projects.

It’s hard to learn how to say no, or even to learn that you can. “Say
yes to everything,” the advice goes. Seize the day. Grab those
opportunities.

But there’s a lot of power in being able to listen to your needs and
carve out the time and space that you need—to meet the world on your
own terms, and to be happy to give because you’re ready to do so.

** Hacking my way into meeting people
I try to minimize the number of things I’ve promised to other people
so that I have the flexibility to follow opportunities when they come
up. Conversations are an exception. It’s hard to not schedule those if
I want to make sure they happen at some point. Left to my own devices,
I might never get around to talking to people. So I pay someone a
small amount to handle my scheduling, which neatly removes me from the
back-and-forth hassles of coordinating times and also (useful and
possibly more important!) prevents me from giving myself excuses not
to do it. Then I remind myself that getting to and from these
appointments is either reading time or free exercise (for in-person
meetings), or possible podcast or blog material (if online). Introvert
hack. =)

** Testing your assumptions
- Most important skill
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Assumptions are helpful
  - They simplify the world
  - They make it possible to make quick decisions. Making assumptions
    helps us take advantage of our past experiences, and we can learn
    from other people's experiences as well.
  - Otherwise, you'd get stuck verifying everything
- Why is it hard
  - Don't know your assumptions
  - Intimidated by measuring
  - Don't want to be wrong
  - Behaviour is hard to change.
- Time
  - Most likely the first thing you need to examine. If you always
    feel rushed for time, you won't have the space to question and
    explore your assumptions.
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Desires
  - Identify
    - What makes you happy?
  - Observe
  - Test
- Expectations and reactions
- Money
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Communication and relationships
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Expectations
- Outlook
- Other areas
- Here are some assumptions I'm looking forward to testing
  - "Uncertainty is scary."
  - "I'm too distractable and scattered to complete writing a book."
  - "It'll be hard to find a form of exercise I like. Besides, gyms
    are often rip-offs anyway."
  - "Guest posts are more trouble than they're worth - hard to find
    people who write well and aren't spammy."

** OUTLINED No good or bad, just different
   SCHEDULED: <2013-07-18 Thu>
- Canada Post lost the passport that was sent through Xpresspost, so
  I need to go through the process of filing for a lost passport:
  official statement, police report, affidavit of
  loss, a rather high lost passport replacement fee, and another
  two months of waiting.

- I was not happy to find out they had lost my passport. I pouted and
  indulged in getting a few hugs from W-, who happened to be working
  from home at the time.

- Cheering up, I said, "I've never lost a passport before. Well, at
  least I get to learn how the process works!" I started singing,
  "Always look on the bright side of life..."

- "Okay, that's a bit of a stretch," W- said. But I think he was
  happy that I could bounce back easily. I know I was.

- Here is something I'm starting to learn about life: situations
  aren't bad or good, they're just different.

- Different is okay. I can deal with different.

- There's always something to be thankful for and something to learn
  from. In this case, I'm glad that we didn't book an August trip
  that we would have to cancel, and I'm glad that we have the space
  to deal with issues like this.

- There will be bigger challenges than this, so this is good
  preparation.

- wring out the most from it
  - go through the process
  - learn about it 
  - write notes
  - take advantage of the wait

Since she doesn’t like taking classes or workshops, she can use that
time to get better at teaching herself. I don’t like taking classes
either, so I know what that’s like. I should probably hack my way
around that, though. There are many things that might be more cost- or
time-effective for me to learn in a class than on my own or from
books.

When I project my current paths out to their peaks, I learn a lot about where I want to go and how I want to get there. For example, I'm currently learning about sales by selling sketchnoting services. I'm starting with that because it's relatively easy to appreciate (yay visuals!), there are established companies in other geographies that have tested the business model and value proposition, and people want it. There's a lot of room to grow. If I imagine being a super-sketchnoter or a super-illustrator, though, I feel like there's something missing. I feel like the focus is on interpreting someone else's ideas instead of creating something marvelous and new. Artists create new things, and there's something fascinating in that.
