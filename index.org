#+TITLE: Sharing Outline
This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!

** Planning a sketch on index cards

** Printing sketchnotes
I printed many of my sketchnotes and put them in a binder. That way, I
can easily flip through them, and I can also spread them out. It was a
good thing I did, because I found myself frequently referring to them
in conversation. It was much more natural to flip through pages than
to jump through images on a tablet, even with a tablet's enhanced
search capabilities. If I find a binder that can double as a landscape
presentation stand, I think that will be solid.

Colour would make this much better. Highlights jump out more with
colour. Different events are easier to distinguish with colour
schemes. We have more of a visceral reaction to colour. The ING Orange
coworking space has an a

I should always keep black and white printing in mind, though, because
that's what many people will have. Observations: foreground colour
isn't enough of a distinguisher. Bright red becomes a dark gray, which
recedes compared to black (or the darkest tone I use). A plain white
background works best, then a dot grid, then a line grid.

Landscape is harder to work with in compilations, but it's better for
viewing on-screen - how do other people handle this well? Must
prototype with binder...

How to listen and draw at the same time


When people see the sketchnotes I post right after presentations , they often ask me: “How do you listen and do all that at the same time?”
Let me let you in on a little secret: I don’t. Not all at the same time. Mostly because during live presentations, I have no idea where the presenter might go.
Depending on how quickly the speaker talks and how much interesting content they pack into their sentences, I might be scrambling to quickly jot down some keywords. When they pause for breath or transition to a new topic, I’ll go back and add stick figures and diagrams. As I figure out which points are important, I move parts of my drawing around or erase and refine what I’ve written.
To help you see the process, here’s a recording of my screen as I sketchnote an hour-long presentation. I don’t draw that fast in real life - I’ve condensed the video to three minutes for your convenience. Enjoy!

** Quantified Time: Consulting Days vs. Open Days
Does work really get in the way of living?
** How does tracking affect your happiness?
** Time-tracking workshop
*** Session 1: The Whys and Hows of Tracking Time
Discuss objectives and motivations for tracking time. Plan possible questions you want to ask of the data (which influences which tools to try and how to collect data). Recommend a set of tools based on people’s interests and context (paper? iPhone? Android? Google Calendar?).
Resources: Presentations on time-tracking, recommendations for tools, more detail on structuring data (categories, fields); possible e-mail campaign for reminders
Output: Planning worksheet for participants to help people remember their motivations and structure their data collection; habit triggers for focused, small-scale data collection, buddying up for people who prefer social accountability
*** Session 2: Staying on the Wagon + Preliminary Analysis
Checking in to see if people are tracking time the way they want to. Online and/or one-on-one check-ins before the workshop date, plus a group session on identifying and dealing with obstacles (because it helps to know that other people struggle and overcome these things). Preliminary analysis of small-scale data.
Resources: Frequently-encountered challenges and how to deal with them; resources on habit design; tool alternatives
Output: Things to try in order to support habit change; larger-scale data collection for people who are doing well
*** Session 3: Analyzing your data
Massaging your data to fit a common format; simple analyses and interpretation
Resources: Common analysis format and some sample charts/instructions; maybe even a web service?
Output: Yay, charts!
*** Session 4: More ways you can slice and dice your data
Bring other questions you’d like to ask, and we’ll show you how to extract that out of your data (if possible – and if not, what else you’ll probably need to collect going forward). Also, understanding and using basic statistics
Resources: Basic statistics, uncommon charts
Output: More analyses!
*** Session 5: Making data part of the way you live
Building a personal dashboard, integrating your time data into your decisions
Outcome: Be able to make day-to-day decisions using your time data; become comfortable doing ad-hoc queries to find out more
*** Session 6: Designing your own experiments
Designing experiments and measuring interventions (A/B/A, how to do a blind study on yourself)
Outcome: A plan for changing one thing and measuring the impact on time
*** Session 7: Recap, Show & Tell
Participants probably have half a year of data and a personal experiment or two – hooray! Share thoughts and stories, inspire each other, and figure out what the next steps look like.
Outcome: Collection of presentations

Requested by Michael Jones,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=113FL6wzGbM&lcor=1&feature=em-comment_received&lc=KpT_4O34JGgJD_mmpkI68GQXwchUaxzf1QfTXJfEx4g&lch=email
http://www.youtube.com/user/Kembread

/Michael Jones wanted to know how I organized my Org Mode files. Here's how I do things!/

[[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode for Emacs]] is an outliner that lets you add a little structure
to plain text files. Not only can you use it to move around, hide, and
show sections of your outline, but you can also:
- schedule tasks and mark them as complete,
- add hyperlinks and formatting,
- estimate effort and track time,
- export to HTML and other formats,
- and even include code that you can run in-line.

I started with a single Org Mode file (appropriately called
organizer.org), but I've gradually fleshed this out into a number of
files. My goals for organizing my files this way are to be able to:

- Publish some files while keeping other files private,
- Add or remove groups of tasks from my agenda, or focus my
  agenda/search on the current file,
- Simplify processing my weekly review (categorizing
  accomplishments/tasks),
- Get a quick overview of important things, and
- Have file-specific options, like columns.

I often use [[http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs#agenda_commands][Org agenda custom commands]] to jump around. For example,
one agenda command lists projects, and pressing RET on an agenda line
will take me to that project. I also use =org-capture= to take a note
from anywhere, and I use =org-goto= to navigate my files. For finding
specific files, I use =ido-find-file=. 

I use several Org Mode files. The five files below have a little more
than 1.3MB of text in total - tiny! - but they help me tremendously. I
also have lots of other Org files like my [[http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs][Emacs configuration]] and [[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3968124/blog.html][my
blog index]] (I often use Org for publishing), but these are my main
files.

*Personal tasks and notes: organizer.org*

This is the catch-all for any tasks or notes that don't belong to the
files below. Here's the rough structure:

- *Quick notes:* Tidbits that might not make it into their own blog
  posts, but which can be included in weekly reviews
- *Reference:* Hours, license keys, etc.
- *Open loops:* Anything I need to check on every so often
- *Projects:* High-level things I'm focusing on
- *Financial goals:* Things to save up for
- *Someday/maybe:* Projects to do someday
- *Weekly review:* Divided by year
- *Monthly review:* More summaries
- *Plans:* Personal plans
- *2011, 2012, 2013...*: I use org-capture to quickly jot down notes.
  The datetree option automatically files them by day, which makes
  older ones easier to archive.
- *Tasks:* A bucket for miscellaneous tasks

*Anything to do with business: business.org*

I organize these by the types of tasks I focus on and the notes I
want to keep.

- Earn
  - Clients
  - Leads
- Build
  - Projects
  - Research
  - Business ideas
  - Blog
  - Delegation
  - Planning
  - Business hygiene (accounting, etc.)
  - Learning
- Connect
  - Meetups
  - Hangouts
  - Other
- Reference
- Tasks

*people.org*

I organize these by relationships so that I can remember who's out
there.

- Family
- Extended family
- Canada friends
- Hacklab
- Barkada
- Letters
- Meetups
- Bloggers
- Family friends
- Other tasks

*routines.org*

I organize these by frequency and omit the tasks from my weekly
review. This also contains my "In case of..." scenarios and my backup
documentation.

- Every day
- Once a week
- Once a month
- Once a quarter
- Once a year
- When...

*[[http://sach.ac/outline][sharing/index.org]]*

I organize this by topic. See http://sach.ac/outline for the
published version!

*decisions.org*

I organize these by status. I also use org-choose markers (ex:
CHOSEN, MAYBE) inside the categories, but the headings make it easier
to review.

- Pending
- Current
- For review
- Someday / maybe
- Archive

*How do you organize your Org files?*

Everyone's got different ways of organizing outlines, and people also
also change over time. How do you organize yours?

** Thinking about how I can use Evernote more effectively

It took me a couple of hours, but I finally cleared the 700+ items
that had piled up in my Evernote inbox. Every so often, I go on a
tagging and filing spree. I was thinking about this because Timothy
Kenny told me how he has a virtual assistant file the notes in his
Microsoft OneNote notebooks.

Is my filing really worth it? Is it something I value enough to pay
someone else to do? Could I explain what I wanted clearly enough so
that other people could do it? Could I benefit from organization even
if I'm not the one organizing things myself?

Before I dig into that, I should probably examine this question: *What
do I use Evernote for, and what could "better" look like?*

Here's a quick summary of the different reasons I use Evernote:

I have different types of clipping activities:
- *A. Researching a topic*, which results in lots of clips related to a
  single topic. Usually in preparation for a blog post or as a way to
  answer a question.
- *B. Casual browsing and clipping* based on blog posts, news items, or
  other things I come across; roughly topical (ex: skill
  development), although may be tagged and filed in different places
- *C. Saving reference material from email or websites*, which should be filed
- *D. Adding notes on the go using my phone*, which should be reviewed
  and acted on or filed when I get back to my computer
- *E. Automatically clipping things based on external input*, using
  services like IFTTT to archive my blog posts.

There are several strategies I could use to manage my Evernote
collection. I can choose different strategies based on the results
that I want. Here are some possibilities:

- *A. Spend a few extra seconds tagging and filing things when I clip
  them.* Advantage: I touch something once, so I don't have to recall
  the context of an item.
- *B. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file shortly after
  clipping.* Advantages: I can select multiple entries and tag them
  give them the same tags, and copy all the note links in one go.
- *C. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then file weekly.* This is my
  current strategy. This isn't working out too well - things pile up.
- *D. Capture everything into an !Inbox, then teach someone to file.*

I think strategy B will give me a good improvement in performance
without me needing to bring in someone else.

One of the areas that I could generally improve in is integrating the
notes into my outlines and plans. Instead of just collecting the
information, maybe I can use Copy Note Link and then spend some time
adding those links to my outline. Alternatively, I can copy the
source URL right then and there, find where it fits into my outline,
and paste the link. If org2blog respects comments, I could even use
that as part of my workflow.

So if I were to outsource more tasks in order to improve my
effectiveness at learning, I think I'd gain more value from finding
someone who can speed-read like I do, filtering through lots of cruft
on the Internet to find high-quality resources. They could then clip
those pages into Evernote for my review. That might be worth an
experiment or two... Let's find out how that works!

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Does org2blog respect comments? If so, I can use that to add more details.

- Sub-outlines
** Mapping skills and prerequisites
- Limitations of outlining

I miss teaching. I had tons of fun teaching computer science when I
was in the Philippines, coming up with different analogies and
exercises. 

Stephanie Diamond suggested making a sketchnotes course on Udemy.
People have asked me about teaching Emacs, or blogging, or Quantified
Self tracking and analysis.

- What would you want to learn for free?
- What would you value at $49?
- What would you value at $99?

Help me figure out a good curriculum that could help you!

** It's okay to be wrong
At an applied rationality meetup in Toronto, the guest speaker
confessed to being afraid of blogging because she didn't want to be
pinned down to words. 

People think of writing as final. The fuzziness of conversation in
memory might let you argue, "That's not what I said," but writing
leaves you no wiggle room. 

It's okay to be wrong.

- What people are afraid of
  - Not being able to adjust
  - Misunderstandings
  - Unexpected audience
- Being wrong
  - Inevitable
  - Story about class
  - Story about blog
  - Story about comics
  - Keeps me honest
- Going forward
  - Not an expert
  - Conversation
  - Modeling it

** What I like writing about
** Writing everywhere
** Collecting stories and quotes
** Improving my writing system
** The power of long lists
** Organizing what I know
** Flipping through my notes
** Getting the hang of passing everything through Evernote
** E-book tips
** Embracing the resistance in terms of writing
The resistance is a symptom that you're on the right track. /The
resistance is not something to be avoided; it's something to seek
out./ ... The artist sees out the feeling of the resistance and then
tries to maximize it. The cog, the day laborer, the compliant
student--they seek to eliminate the feeling instead.

Imagine I have amazing assistants and a smoothly-running team. What am I doing with those capabilities?

2 days a week, I'm focused on talking to people. I'm booked efficiently; tea, lunch, tea, second tea. Some of these meetings involve walks instead of food. The meetings cluster in various locations in order to minimize travel time. I might have one day for face-to-face meetings and one day for virtual meetings.

After each meeting, I have at least half an hour to define next actions and get the ball rolling. It's easy to prioritize based on time and importance. We get the first actions out right away, impressing people, and then we follow up with depth. My assistant fills in the time with other tasks from the next actions list. I have at least 20 hours of work for people, so it's easy for them to focus.

Types of things I delegate:
Scheduling - I forward them emails and get back neatly formatted calendar entries
Email response handling - they read my mail, prioritize, send me action items, and work on tasks.
Web research - I send them questions and get back summaries of the top ten resources I should read. I suggest search queries, and they add their own.
Illustration - I have backup illustrators who can sketchnote things that I can't get to, or who can share different styles and metaphors.
Development - When I have an idea about Rails or Wordpress, I can work with someone to make it happen.
Web design - themes, tweaks, beautifully HTMLized pages...
Copywriting and copyediting - I send things over and get polished, engaging content
Calls - Assistants can take care of calling businesses when they're open and following up if needed, such as when setting appointments or making reservations.
Layout - I share a Dropbox folder with a bunch of graphics or documents. The assistant lays things out so that they're well-balanced in terms of whitespace and size.
Transcription - I save webinars and interviews (or set people up to record) into a Dropbox shared folder, and I send an email. I get a well-formatted blog post or document with the cleaned-up transcript.
Outlining and writing - someone helps me brainstorm blog post topics and outlines, fleshing them out with research, and organizing the topics into books
Video - editing, synchronizing sound, adding transitions, etc.
...

I also have recurring tasks for projects and initiatives I care about. Things just work smoothly. I get confirmations.

I have this lovely web-based process manual and a visual overview of tasks.

I'm always collecting people for my pipeline.
Hiring is not stressful - I have good onboarding and offboarding
processes. I hire shortly before I really need to, so that I can ramp
up people.

** Year 2 Review
** Learning from how other people delegate

** OUTLINED How I (want to) use outsourcing and automation to help me learn more effectively
# <<outsource-learning>>

- Learning from people
  - [ ] Identify interesting people to learn from
    - Hmm... is there a way I can do this more efficiently? Scanning
      the first 50 Google Blog Search results gets me 5
      high-quality resources, which I could probably filter just
      based on the titles alone.
    - Huh. This could be harder than I thought, because I'm not that
      happy with the resources that are out there. Maybe I should
      figure out a better strategy.
    - What do I want in terms of learning from people?
      - Write blog posts with links to other people's interesting perspectives
      - Slowly collect interesting people to follow in my feed reader
      - Keep in mind the specialties of my blog readers and other
        people who don't blog on their own
    - Possible outsourcing approach
      - SPEC: Given a topic, give me an outline or spreadsheet
       highlighting bloggers who have written good blog posts about the
       topic
        - well-written (good English, few grammar or spelling mistakes,
          good paragraph separation, maybe uses bold/color/italics for
          emphasis)
        - includes personal experiences, not just generic advice or reblogging
        - includes action items or recommendations
        - includes links to other resources (and not just
          selling content or promoting a business)
        - discussed: has at least two comments, one of which should be
          a reply from the author (unless the post is less than a week old)
        - active: at least 1 post a month, and has posted recently
      - Rubric:
        - Excellent: 
          - Went through ~10 pages of Google Blog Search and
            narrowed it down to 5-10 excellent bloggers/posts
          - Highlighted bloggers who wrote repeatedly about a topic, browsing through
            categories or tags to find related posts
          - Added a short description of how the bloggers' viewpoints
            differ from each other  
        - Good:
          - Went through ~5 pages of Google Blog Search and narrowed it
            down to 5-10 good bloggers/posts
          - Organized the list of bloggers to put excellent/insightful
            blogs at the top
        - Mediocre: 
          - Sends a list of URLs with no explanations
          - Includes blog posts that are generic, self-promotional

** What would you do with more money?  :link:
One of the downsides of building a really good frugality muscle (that reflexive reaction of "Oh, I don't really need this, do I?") is that

I’ve been reading through Mr. Money Mustache’s blog archive, and his blog post on What would you do with WAY MORE money? made me think about what I value and what I would change. Like him, I’m comfortable with the way things are. I like eating at home. I like getting books and movies from the library instead of buying them. (No storage or waste issues, wide selection, and the satisfaction of boosting library circulation statistics…) I like my hobbies and interests. I like my freedom from the endless hedonic treadmill.
Not even the latest apps or gadgets, aside from the occasional experiment. (Shh! I hope they don’t take away my geek card. ;) )
About the only thing that would be awesomer would be to make more frequent trips to the Philippines (maybe every year! or on a whim!) or to join family and friends on their vacations. Although that’s constrained by other things too, like the fact that I like spending time with W- and he needs to be here in Toronto for J-.

** Living an off-peak life  :link:

It’s finally spring in full force, and I’ve been biking whenever I can get away with it. The bike ride is a little faster than the subway commute to my client, and I like not have to squeeze into the crowded train. Free exercise along a well-maintained trail with plenty of flowers and trees…

http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/04/07/a-peak-life-is-lived-off-peak/

** Substituting pleasures
It’s been easier and easier to substitute pleasures. A $12 bowl of pho is yummy, but a $2 banh mi sandwich will do just fine. Why buy a DVD (even a used one) if there are so many unwatched ones at the library? I have clothes I haven’t worn in ages.
** Managing my personal and business finances
** Time and gadget tradeoffs
** What's worth spending on?
I'd been contemplating this question for the past four years.

What's worth spending on? I invest for the future, save for unexpected expenses, and support causes and people - but it's good to have that discretionary part of my budget which I can use to enjoy life and learn how to make better decisions.

Many people care about stuff. I apporeciate that. There are many examples of things that have enabled me to enjoy and learn from life so much more, such as my tablet PC.

Many people care about experiences. I appreciate that, too. I like how experiences can lead to deeper relationships.

Many people know something else that I'm just beginning to figure out. You can spend on people, on time, on making things happen. This is awesome! There's a candy store of talent out there - a world full of people with unique experiences, skills, and passions.

Like the way I've learned about what works well for me in terms of
spending on stuff and experiences, I want to learn how to spend on
making things happen. And who knows? If I can get good enough at it,
maybe I can learn how to create so much value that it becomes a
self-perpetuating machine.

** It's about time

(personal motivation)
More than anything, I wanted time. Ever since I was a kid, I had
always been acutely aware of how short a time we actually have. (Can I
blame this on reading about Raistlin's hourglass eyes in Dragonlance,
which I suppose was my first introduction to Stoic negative
visualization?) Being halfway around the world from family is hard
enough. I see the time pass for my parents in their Facebook pictures
and on our Skype calls. As for here, W- is much older than I am, and I
want to make the most of the time that I have with him.

** Not optimizing for productivity

One of the people I was chatting with was interested in measuring
productivity. As I started thinking about it, I realized that I care
about making sure I’m not breaking many promises. Sometimes I slip up,
and then I know I have to slow down and take my time. I’m curious
about some things that might improve my effectiveness (dictation or
podcasting for these posts, to make the words flow better? automated
tests for my coding? visual vocabularies for my drawing?), but they
tend to be more qualitative than...

** Rediscovering the renaissance life :link:
"It must be nice

But my own favorite part of the book was in the description of the “Renaissance Man ideal”. This is the idea that you will have the most enjoyable life, AND the best chance at very early financial independence, by developing a whole load of interesting skills. The amazing part is that these skills don’t just sit independently in your mind like a bunch of unused kitchen appliances in a pantry. They start to reach out and connect to each other in unexpected ways, and start solving all of your problems for you. They build your curiosity and start sucking in still more skills that you can’t help acquiring. And before you know it, you are able to live a superb life on only a tiny fraction of the spending that a normal person does, even while you might end up accidentally earning money even more easily than before you embraced the Renaissance Ideal.

** Open loops :link:

It’s been more than ten years since David Allen published Getting
Things Done. I still haven’t come up with a fully trustable system,
but Emacs + Org + Evernote is getting there. I’m glad I’m back to
using Org. I’m starting to run into the reminders I set for important
business paperwork last year, and I might have missed that if I was
relying on my memory or my calendar.

From time to time, when I catch myself feeling frazzled, I stop and
write down all of my open loops: the things that tug on my attention.
Some of them must be ruthlessly demoted to “someday/maybe,” or even
let go. And then I can methodically go through the others, crossing
them off as I finish them. Getting it all down on paper helps me make
sense of things and stops me from feeling overwhelmed.

** Tool talk: Clipboard managers
Clipboard managers

Ditto - want more of a collection view
ClipMate - does not keep transparent backgrounds, but otherwise interesting collection management. Fixed transparency by enabling DIB and TIFF! Okay, we're good to go.

Decision criteria:
- must be able to organize clips into collections that don't get buried under new clips (can select collection)
- pen-friendly
- always-on-top


Stuf: transparent, good previous, but doesn't seem to have an always-on-top view

Clipboard Master: not transparent

Clipboard Fusion - can't handle images, I think

Try ClipMate because of the interface for selecting clips

Intended uses:
- Text for filenames
- Clipped images for pasting into a layer; not transparent, so darken only?

** Getting better at learning from online courses
* Connecting
** I like being introverted  :snippets:

Sometimes people tell me that they can’t believe I’m introverted. You
organize meetups, they say. You share a lot online. You can’t possibly
be introverted. Not only do I need to recharge after conferences or
other intense social interactions, I like being introverted – it’s
good to be comfortable with yourself. That said, you learn a lot when
you bump into other people, so I’ve been experimenting with ways to
have more of those serendipitous conversations.

I like group conversations more than one-on-ones because I get to
learn from the intersections of people’s interests. I see different
aspects of people than I might bring out on my own. Group
conversations also reduce the pressure to carry the conversation
myself – people bring their own questions and tips and ideas to the
table.

I’m particularly interested in virtual meetups because there are so
many wonderful people out there whom I will probably never be in the
same city with. Toronto is a great meetup city because there’s always
something going on, but there’s no reason why knowledge-sharing should
be unnecessarily privileged or limited by geographic proximity. If
people are curious about blogging, drawing, Emacs, Quantified Self, or
whatever we have in common, maybe we can have virtual show-and-tells
instead of relying on the probability of finding critical mass for a
meetup in our own areas.

---
I get my energy from a quiet and simple life. I’ve learned to say no
when I need more space: no if I need quiet instead of networking (even
if there could be someone who could change my life or vice versa just
over there); no if I need silence instead of a taxi cab conversation;
no to people’s requests in favour of spending time with W- or on my
own projects.

It’s hard to learn how to say no, or even to learn that you can. “Say
yes to everything,” the advice goes. Seize the day. Grab those
opportunities.

But there’s a lot of power in being able to listen to your needs and
carve out the time and space that you need—to meet the world on your
own terms, and to be happy to give because you’re ready to do so.

** Hacking my way into meeting people
I try to minimize the number of things I’ve promised to other people
so that I have the flexibility to follow opportunities when they come
up. Conversations are an exception. It’s hard to not schedule those if
I want to make sure they happen at some point. Left to my own devices,
I might never get around to talking to people. So I pay someone a
small amount to handle my scheduling, which neatly removes me from the
back-and-forth hassles of coordinating times and also (useful and
possibly more important!) prevents me from giving myself excuses not
to do it. Then I remind myself that getting to and from these
appointments is either reading time or free exercise (for in-person
meetings), or possible podcast or blog material (if online). Introvert
hack. =)

** Testing your assumptions
- Most important skill
  - Identify
  - Observe
  - Test
- Assumptions are helpful
  - They simplify the world
  - They make it possible to make quick decisions. Making assumptions
    helps us take advantage of our past experiences, and we can learn
    from other people's experiences as well.
  - Otherwise, you'd get stuck verifying everything
- Why is it hard
  - Don't know your assumptions
  - Intimidated by measuring
  - Don't want to be wrong
  - Behaviour is hard to change.
- Time
  - Most likely the first thing you need to examine. If you always
    feel rushed for time, you won't have the space to question and
    explore your assumptions.

  - Observe
  - Test
- Desires
  - Identify
    - What makes you happy?

- Communication and relationships

  - "It'll be hard to find a form of exercise I like. Besides, gyms
    are often rip-offs anyway."

    people who write well and aren't spammy."

** DONE Homebody
   CLOSED: [2013-07-28 Sun 20:32]
Saturday afternoon. It had started raining, so W- put away his tools and stopped working on the deck stairs. He asked if I wanted to go out and do something fun – maybe watch a movie, or have pho? 

I checked the movie listings. Nothing particularly worth watching on the big screen instead of on our television, and we had food in the fridge. So we stayed home, watched one of the movies we’d checked out from the library, and enjoyed some home-made pizza.

We haven’t been to a movie theatre in ages (ever since I decided that actually, even superhero blockbusters are just fine on the small screen). The library is the source of a constant stream of DVDs. While there are long waits for the latest releases, there are plenty of old movies we can go through. I’ve gotten accustomed to watching with subtitles and the ability to pause or rewind, which is great since many movies involve at least one mumbly moment. Besides, if we watch at home, we can make jokes.

I am such a homebody. My default is to spend time at home, and I enjoy it. I love reading, writing, drawing, coding. Tidying up is slightly less fun, but it’s also useful. We’re not hermits – we go to the supermarket, the library, the hardware store – but we don’t often go out just for recreation.

I go out occasionally – more often than W- goes out. I go to the clients’ offices. I go to HackLab to hang out with other geeks and learn from them. I go to friends’ get-togethers. And then I come home and recharge.

Back when I lived at home, my parents took me and my sisters out a lot: eating at restaurants, strolling through the malls. I hardly go shopping here, aside from the occasional stressful sprint when I need to restock my shoes or clothes. I hardly go to restaurants, either. When I get together with friends, it’s usually in someone’s kitchen. 

I think the trick is to embrace it instead of wondering what other people are doing.

  - Determine critical uncertainties (impact vs certainty)
  - Back into decision-making process - strategy that creates value
    in several scenarios, backup plan

The point of scenario planning, after all, is not to be right, which
is such a human inclination that we find it hard to overcome—the point
of scenario planning is to see the future from perspectives we would
have a difficult time forcing ourselves to imagine because of our bias
toward rightness, and therefore imagine new possibilities or see
threats we might otherwise miss.
The trick is to know we will always be wrong as we speculate about the
future

Yet, the purpose of scenario planning is not to pinpoint future events
but to highlight large-scale forces that push the future in different
directions. It's about making these forces visible, so that if they do
happen, the planner will at least recognize them. It's about helping
make better decisions today.

** OUTLINED No good or bad, just different
- Canada Post lost the passport that was sent through Xpresspost, so
  I need to go through the process of filing for a lost passport:
  official statement, police report, affidavit of
  loss, a rather high lost passport replacement fee, and another
  two months of waiting.

- I was not happy to find out they had lost my passport. I pouted and
  indulged in getting a few hugs from W-, who happened to be working
  from home at the time.

- Cheering up, I said, "I've never lost a passport before. Well, at
  least I get to learn how the process works!" I started singing,
  "Always look on the bright side of life..."

- "Okay, that's a bit of a stretch," W- said. But I think he was
  happy that I could bounce back easily. I know I was.

- Here is something I'm starting to learn about life: situations
  aren't bad or good, they're just different.
  
- Different is okay. I can deal with different.

- There's always something to be thankful for and something to learn
  from. In this case, I'm glad that we didn't book an August trip
  that we would have to cancel, and I'm glad that we have the space
  to deal with issues like this.
  
- There will be bigger challenges than this, so this is good
  preparation.

- wring out the most from it
  - go through the process
  - learn about it 
  - write notes
  - take advantage of the wait

** Creating space for myself
** Making my own opportunities
** Relaxing
** Learning on your own

(snippet from life)
Since she doesn’t like taking classes or workshops, she can use that
time to get better at teaching herself. I don’t like taking classes
either, so I know what that’s like. I should probably hack my way
around that, though. There are many things that might be more cost- or
time-effective for me to learn in a class than on my own or from
books.

** Learning Japanese with Anki flashcards
** Learning Cantonese
** Things I don't like about providing support - assumptions to question?
Waiting for a response, and wanting to be able to respond quickly -
maybe setting expectations?

** Living an awesome life
*** Figuring out what you want
*** Keeping it simple
** Libraries
** Manifesto
** Semi-retirement
** The difference between what you do and who you are: a reflection on skills, talents, and identities
** Dried fruits and nuts
** Making my own things
When I project my current paths out to their peaks, I learn a lot about where I want to go and how I want to get there. For example, I'm currently learning about sales by selling sketchnoting services. I'm starting with that because it's relatively easy to appreciate (yay visuals!), there are established companies in other geographies that have tested the business model and value proposition, and people want it. There's a lot of room to grow. If I imagine being a super-sketchnoter or a super-illustrator, though, I feel like there's something missing. I feel like the focus is on interpreting someone else's ideas instead of creating something marvelous and new. Artists create new things, and there's something fascinating in that.

Object
- Record rainfall, flooded power plant, rolling blackouts
- Power's back to normal, I think
- What I do in case of a power outage
  - Get the hand-cranked radio/flashlight from my emergency bag
  - Listen to AM radio while drawing or reading
  - Munch on shelf-stable food, like Skyflakes and hazelnut-chocolate spread
- Drawing from comic books and from life
- A little odd not looking things up on the Internet
- When I draw on paper, my hand gets tired faster.
- Checked out nearby library, but there were lots of people. Didn't
  need to eat out.
- Childhood: lots of power outages during the Cory Aquino
  administration in the Philippines
- I remember my mom would try to make sure we could sleep in the
  heat
  - sometimes fanning us herself
  - battery-operated fan, but she would still stay up and take care
    of us

- Why
  - I don't want to spend a lot of time answering e-mail
  - Pavlovian stimulus-response
  - Actually, not many things are urgent
- What kind of e-mail do I get
  - Quick questions
    - Links to blog posts, or
  - In-depth questions
    - Answered by blog posts
- How I process my e-mail
  - I check every so often on my phone
    - Objective
      - Get rid of stuff I don't need to pay attention to
      - Find out if anything needs to be handled today, or if things
        can wait until Friday
    - When
      - Waking up
      - Walking around
      - Waiting in line
- Friday is my "catch up" day
  - Balance my books, follow up on waiting tasks, and respond to
    e-mail
- I use Boomerang to remind me about important messages if I need to
  follow up
- Other people's advice
  - Touch it once: Check mail only when I'm at my computer and ready
    to respond to things
    - Have to set aside time each day to respond to e-mail
  - Be strict about checking only at specified times (ex: once a week)
    - Sounded too... well... distant
- So if you've written to me
  - No need to apologize if it takes you a few weeks to reply

* 5-year experiment
** What I'm learning from my 5-year experiment

** OUTLINED Experiment review: Income and expenses
- Preparation
  - Projecting my expenses
  - Main costs: $10k a year

- More curious about life, creation - the things people can't pay you
  to do
- Backup plan
** Preparing for uncertainties

- Structure of 5-year experiment
- The more I try things out, the more I learn, the more I wander from
  my original plan
- Useful tool: imagine worst-case scenario
- http://sachachua.com/blog/2012/12/experiment-pre-mortem-imagining-and-dealing-with-causes-of-failure/

** Anticipating experiment outcomes
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I probably
  don't have to work again"?
  - Writing, drawing, coding based on my own interests
  - Sharing as much as possible
  - Open to receiving payment from other people as a way of funding
    more experiments - maybe tie value directly to experiments in a
    micro-Kickstarter sort of way?
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I want to
  'lean in' in terms of business?"
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I don't have
  to work a regular job again"?
- How would I live if the outcome of this experiment is "I want to go
  back to a regular job?"
  - Rebuild my network and dust off my resume
  - Probably go back to a technical position in a good team
