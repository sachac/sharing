This is a rough outline of things I'd like to write about, screencast,
draw, or share. index.org is written in Org Mode for Emacs, and it's
the file that generates index.html. Issues and pull requests welcome
(index.org preferred, but I can understand HTML patches too)!

Inspired by anything? Feel free to write your own posts, and send me
a link.

*** Learning
   Since she doesn’t like taking classes or workshops, she can use that time to get better at teaching herself. I don’t like taking classes either, so I know what that’s like. I should probably hack my way around that, though. There are many things that might be more cost- or time-effective for me to learn in a class than on my own or from books.
*** Things I don't like about providing support - assumptions to question?
Waiting for a response, and wanting to be able to respond quickly -
maybe setting expectations?

*** Planner
My blog grew out of Planner Mode, an organizer for Emacs. I used Planner to keep track of my tasks and notes. As an experiment, I published them on the web.
