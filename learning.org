* Questions

Help me figure things out! E-mail me with your thoughts and ideas.

- Emacs
	- What are the best resources out there? How can we logically arrange them so that people can find the appropriate resources for their level?
	- How can we make it easier and less intimidating for people to customize Emacs through Emacs Lisp?
    - I'm working on https://github.com/sachac/emacs-notes/blob/gh-pages/how-to-read-emacs-lisp.org
	- How can we inspire people to learn more?
		- I'm recording Emacs Chats (to help people get to know Emacs), screencasts, and show-and-tells
    - I blog about how I tweak Emacs
	- How can we help people get a sense of other people in the community, and feel like they belong?
		- I'm recording Emacs Chats (to help people get to know Emacs), screencasts, and show-and-tells
    - I want to create something like "usesthis"
	- What makes code beautiful or idiomatic Emacs Lisp?
- Coaching
	- How can I connect with people who want to learn more about Emacs? How can I keep track of their progress and guide them along their path?
- Sharing
  - I've shared a _lot_ of stuff. How can I organize things so that they make sense to other people?
	- How can I organize things so that I remember more effectively?
	- How can I repurpose things to address different learning styles or needs?
- How can I garden more effectively with the setup that I have?
  - Trying hand-watering, attention
  - Will try bulk compost
- Delegation: What kinds of tasks can I ask others to do? How can I help people develop their skills?
- How can I get better at learning from other people?
- What do other people need or want that is easy for me to provide?

What do I eventually want? I want to be able to see how quickly I'm accumulating new tasks and checking off DONE tasks. It would be interesting to look at the proportion, too, but that can come later. So first, I want a table that looks like this:

Hmm, maybe I'll go ahead and calculate that first.

- [2014-01-05]: If I use red, I usually have to colour-correct it in Autodesk Sketchbook Pro so that it doesn't look pink. I haven't figured out how to automate this yet, since Autodesk Sketchbook Pro neatly allows me to avoid correcting grayscale items. Per image, it's a few clicks and a drag. Leaning towards blue again. Red is more fun, though.

Every so often, I make a list of things I would like to learn or work
on. Not only does thinking about what I want to learn help me decide
how to spend my time, it also makes it easier for me to ask for help.
I don't refer to the previous lists while making a new one, because
the differences between the lists gives me valuable information. If my
new list is missing some things that were on my previous list, that
tells me that my priorities and interests have changed. I can decide
whether I want to go back to those old priorities, or if it's okay to
shelve those ideas for later.

Here's my current list:

** Business

- Consulting for E1: Plugin development might be an excellent new skill to add so that I can hit even more home runs when it comes to client requests
- Tech skills: This is too good an advantage to waste, and I enjoy it.
  - Automation/productivity hacking: More text, data, and image processing! More macros and shortcuts and application scripting!
  - System administration: It's good to have a solid platform and a streamlined development process. I want to learn more about managing multiple sites, setting up reliable backup and restore systems, automating deployment, and keeping up with security updates.
  - Web development: It's so nice to be able to quickly build my own systems. I want to get better at writing neat, solid code that follows best practices so that I can rely on tests to keep me from breaking things that I infrequently modify.
  - Web design: I really like using HTML5 and Javascript for data visualization, and I want to get even better at doing that.
  - Other geekery: 3D printing, electronics, sensors, speech recognition, scripting… there's so much to play with. =)
- Writing: It's a fantastic way to learn.
  - Collecting and organizing my blog posts, then filling in the gaps: Right now, people discover lots of my posts through search engines, and I write new things based on what I'm learning or what other people ask me about. I want to get better at making an outline and filling it in so that I can guide more people along their journeys.
  - Exploring more visual formats: This takes more work up front, but it can be more enjoyable and more accessible for people. Someday it would be great to be comfortable making comic books and illustrated guides!
- Drawing: It's becoming more and more fun, and people find it useful too.
  - Drawing people and situations: It would be fun to learn how to draw manga characters well, because that will give me anchors for my imagination.
  - Animated sequences: Wouldn't it be nifty to be able to put together short explanations and tutorials that help people learn useful things?

** Relationships

- Cooking: I want to try lots of recipes so that we can enjoy a variety of yummy and healthy meals at home.
- Gardening: I'd like to learn how to work with the seasons and the soil for a productive and happy garden.
- Enjoying time with and helping family and friends

** Life

- Languages: I'd like to be comfortable enough with Japanese that I can read manga, watch animé, listen to tech podcasts or read articles, and go to technical conferences. Super-awesome level would be to sketchnote something in Japanese – that would be a challenge! I also want to be able to chat with W-, neighbours, and shopkeepers in Cantonese. (And let's throw Latin in there for quirky fun…)
- Exercise: Learning good exercise habits will have lifelong benefits.
- Learning: I could get even better at learning by building habits around spaced-repetition study and practical application. I could expand my range by learning how to learn from online courses. I could get deeper into learning from books, blog posts, conversations, and experiences. I could get better at reviewing, consolidating, and sharing what I'm learning.
- Making decisions: Quantified Self, tracking, applied rationality, all sorts of other good things…
- Sewing: Useful skill, and might be a way for me to work around clothes shopping. =)

** Thoughts

Compared to my list from January, it looks like traditional sales,
marketing, and entrepreneurship skills aren't as large a part of my
list at the moment. Delegation is lower too because I'm less
interested in scaling up beyond myself (at the moment) and more
interested in making the most of my flexibility. I haven't dug into
Android development, so I can probably shelve that for now. Connecting
is still somewhat interesting, though.

Now, how do I want to learn?

I like the idea of working on personal projects, and possibly applying
the skills commercially if people get inspired. Being able to follow
my interests is one of the advantages of this semi-retirement, so I
should make the most of that. Maybe that looks like this: “Hmm, that
seems like an interesting idea… <clackety-clack> Let's see if we can
build a quick prototype… Here it is, and here's a blog post about what
I'm learning along the way!”

I'm not very good at asking for help. I'm too comfortable with my
limits. I might learn something more slowly, or not as effectively as
I could with other people's help, but that's okay. If I rely only on
myself, though, I think I'd miss out on all the interesting
opportunities that happen when you learn together with other people.
I'm not entirely clear on what that might look like. I imagine that it
would be along the lines of, “Hey, check out this thing I just
learned!” “Oooh, that's serendipitously close to what I've been
learning – check this out!” “That's super-helpful. What did you think
about this other thing?” … Which is actually what I have through this
blog, so I guess it works out after all. Onward with the blog posts,
then.

I also tend to feel a little scattered, mostly because I work and
write in short chunks (~2-4 hours of learning). The blog's
chronological format obscures the growth in various areas over time,
unless you look at a category view – and that's not really a map,
either. I've been maintaining a topical index to make it easier to see
blog posts, but it might be interesting to mindmap the key things I
want to know, look at what I already know, and identify the specific
small gaps I want to address first.

Mm. That might work. If I map out the questions, I can pick from this
grab-bag of curiosities. Who knows where that might lead? So much good
stuff out there!

** Quick update 2012-04-01
Going into business myself means major changes to my time budget and
learning plan! =) Will continue to refine this as I go along.

** Time budget from 2011-12-14

Nudged by [[https://twitter.com/#!/catehstn/status/146994766075265024][@catehstn]]'s recommendation of my blog to [[https://twitter.com/#!/Tending2Entropy/status/146985789941755904][@Tending2Entropy]] as
an example of goal planning in personal life, I updated my learning
plan with [[http://sachachua.com/blog/learn-2012/][the things I'm planning to learn next year]].

It was easy to come up with a quick outline. There are so many
interesting things I want to learn. The tough part, however, was
thinking about what I might actually get to do.

What does my cognitive surplus look like? I wanted to get a sense of
how much discretionary time I actually had on a regular basis. I have
about 20 weeks of data since I resumed time-tracking near the end of
July. So that my numbers wouldn't be thrown off by the vacation we
took, I focused on the last eight weeks ([[http://quantifiedawesome.com/time/graph/2011-10-16/2011-12-11][graph: 2011-10-16 to
2011-12-11]]).

Over the eight-week period, I got an average of 3.5 hours of
discretionary time per weekday and 7 hours of discretionary time per
weekend day. I can simplify that to an average of 4.5 hours per day,
which comes out to 1642 hours for 2012 (not including vacations, which
include more discretionary time).

Around 40% of discretionary time was used for social activities. Let's
say that another 30% is a buffer for breaks and other things that come
up, leaving 30% for focused learning. That gives me a time budget of
around 500 hours. I want to do more than 1,000. Hmm.

Prioritization is important. I can focus on the things I want the
most, then see how the rest of the year shakes out. Plans will change
anyway, and estimates are flexible. My first few priorities for
personal learning:

- Android development, so that I can save time syncing and get more of the data I want
- Goal tracking (handy for keeping the rest of my time in line)
- Behavioural change (trying small experiments)

Another way to deal with the gap is to shift more time. Over those
eight weeks, tidying took about 0.7 hours / day, and cooking took
about that much time too. Let's say half of future tidying and all of
future cooking is outsourceable at $20/hour. That's an additional 384
hours for a trade-off of $7,680 after tax, which is a large chunk of
money. I'd rather save the money and let it compound for later use,
especially if I time chores so that they take advantage of low energy.
Besides, cooking and other chores are partly social time too.

I can shift time in other ways. For example, I can use commuting time
to learn more about Emacs, Org, and Rails, so that will help too. I
can also use walking time to record life stories if I can figure out a
workflow for dealing with audio or short notes.

Good to know what the size of the box is, and how much I want to pack
into it! Let's see how it all works out...
* Learning plans from 2010

What do I want to learn? There's a lot more than this, but it's a good starting map! I'll fill this out with notes along the way.

- Work
  - Helping clients succeed and be happy
    - Why this matters: Our clients work on amazing things, and IBM has many talents and resoures. If IBM and I can support clients in making the kind of difference they want to make, we can all make the world better.
    - Ideal: I help clients envision the possible, troubleshoot problems, navigate IBM's capabilities, and work with IBM on making things happen.
    - Strengths I can build on
      - I'm great at connecting people, tools, and resources across the organization. This is something many clients and many IBMers have a hard time with. If I build on this strength, I can help more people learn how to do this well.
      - I'm also good at understanding the big picture and communicating it to other people. I can empathize with clients' objectives and communicate that big picture with people in IBM.
    - How I can grow
      - Find role models and mentors who exemplify this for clients or industries
      - Move from development or consulting into a client account supporting role
      - Map out my network and strategies for connecting
    - Notes
      - I want to work cross-brand instead of focusing on a particular brand
      - I would like to either focus on a specific client or a specific industry
      - I particularly like the public sector because of how they collaborate, but I'm happy to explore other industries as well
  - Connecting the dots
    - Why this matters: Being able to connect people with other people, tools, and resources not only saves a lot of time and effort, but it also starts all these great collaborations. People get inspired when they find out about other people working on similar things, and together, they build something better than they could make on their own.
    - Ideal: Not only am I a go-to person when people need to find other people or things, but I've pushed my knowledge into the network and helped build communities so that other people can find people, tools, and resources without relying on connectors like me.
    - Strengths I can build on: I can remember what or who to look for when the need arises. I love keeping track of a diverse network of people, and lots of people tell me about interesting things that are going on. I can forward requests to the right community or to connectors who have wide networks as well. I take notes and help publicize other people's work, helping them become even more findable. Even though I've only been working at IBM for two years, people often ask me for help in finding people or resources. Imagine what this will be like when I've got more experience!
    - How I can grow
      - Organize my feeds so that I can keep track of more information
      - Document and share more of my network knowledge
      - Help people learn how to do what I do
      - Map the organization
  - Contributing to Smarter Cities and a smarter planet
    - Why this matters: I believe in what we're doing at IBM and our ability to really help transform the way the world works. Our vision around Smarter Cities (and a smarter planet, in general) can touch many, many people's lives.
    - Ideal: I help organizations and jurisdictions around the world learn more about Smarter Cities and a smarter planet. I can refer them to relevant examples and success stories. I help people envision the future, develop roadmaps, and implement initiatives.
    - Strengths I can build on: Although I don't have a deep knowledge of this area yet, I do have many mentors and colleagues who are working on this, and I can learn from them and from the knowledgebases they're building. I'm also passionate about what we're all working towards.
    - How I can grow
      - Review all the Smarter Cities material that's out there
      - Shadow or participate in engagements
      - Bring together and summarize external examples
      - Learn from other IBMers as they work on engagements
  - Sharing what I'm learning and organizing the information so that people can learn more effectively
    - Why this matters: It's amazing how much sharing can save people time, inspire people, and start great conversations. People really value the notes that I've shared through blog posts and presentations. I want to get even better at documenting, sharing, and organizing what I know, so that other people can build even better things on that foundation.
    - Ideal: Every day, I share as much as I can of what I've learned. In addition to chronological updates, people can explore what I'm sharing through an organized map that makes it easy to see the big picture. I am clear, concise, and coherent. I package knowledge in different forms to fit different needs: blog posts, wikis, presentations, videos, books. I inspire other people to share, too, and I help them learn how to do so effectively.
    - Strengths I can build on: Blogging has helped me learn how to write freely and quickly. I'm comfortable with giving energetic and engaging presentations, and I'm also good at preparing stand-alone presentations and videos. I'm comfortable building wikis. I'm good at searching my archives to find things I've already written. I love learning from people, books, and other sources. I make time to share what I know, and I have plenty of success stories that reinforce the value of that investment.
    - How I can grow
      - Map what I know and map what I want to learn, then organize my notes accordingly.
      - Read and learn from blogs and books by other people who are focused on sharing.
      - Edit and organize excerpts from my archive into a more coherent form, such as an e-book.
      - Explore a random information management system (like a "morgue file") to capture snippets of information for later processing.
      - Coach people on how to share and organize what they know.
  - Facilitating visions, discussions, and decisions
    - Why this matters: If we can figure out how to bring people together for more effective discussions both online and in real-life, we can tap the power in the diverse perspectives in a group.
    - Ideal: I can confidently and effectively set up, facilitate, and summarize different kinds of discussions: creating a vision, brainstorming and developing ideas, and deciding on priorities and actions.
    - Strengths I can build on: I can respond very positively to ideas and help think of further improvements. I'm good at organizing and facilitating virtual discussions involving hundreds of people. I type and read very quickly, so I can capture what people are sharing or quickly summarize a long virtual discussion. My background helps me bring perspectives that many people are interested in (Gen Y, social networks, etc.).
    - How I can grow
      - Learn from other consultants
      - Facilitate small workshop sessions
      - Explore other facilitation techniques
  - Inspiring and leading others, and helping others become more effective leaders
    - Why this matters: People can work much better when they're happier and when they can see their role in the big picture. Great management and great leadership make such a big difference in people's working lives.
    - Ideal: I inspire people though my energy and passion, and I help them discover or rediscover their own energy and passion, understand the big picture, and communicate that to other people. I help formal leaders learn how to use social networks to connect and inspire. I help informal leaders learn how to grow and share. Together, we figure out how organizations can be even better.
    - Strengths I can build on: I have a lot of energy, and I really love what we do and why we do it. I'm good at expressing that through blogs, presentations, and other media. I'm good at seeing the bright side of life. I'm good at figuring out my connection to the big picture, and at showing other people why their work matters. I'm consistently happy (can't help it; life is awesome!).
    - How I can grow
      - Explore leadership ideas with Rawn Shah, John Handy-Bosma, Sarah Siegel, and other IBMers thinking a lot about this topic
      - Continue to share my passion, energy, and happiness
      - Help explain the big picture or the bright side, particularly during challenging times
      - Express more appreciation publicly, to help people remember/see the good stuff
      - Coach people on how to share their energy/passion/vision as well
- Life
  - Being happy
    - Why this matters: Happiness has lots of other good things in it. I care about happiness not because I want to be happy–I already am!–but because I want to stay happy, deepen my understanding of happiness, and share that understanding with other people.
    - Ideal: I figure out what works for me and what doesn't, and the difference between making myself miserable and growing by stepping outside my comfort zone. I share what I've learned and my processes for learning with other people. I help lots of other people grow happier.
    - Strengths I can build on: I'm very very happy. I have an awesome life. I'm an optimist (almost automatic now!). I enjoy reflection. I like sharing what I'm learning with other people.
    - How I can grow
      - Take on new challenges, like marriage and parenting, to figure out more about happiness with a richer and more complex life.
      - Share more appreciation and reflection.
  - Practicing relentless improvement
    - Why this matters: Getting better and better at life means saving time, enjoying more benefits, deepening my appreciation of life, learning things I can share with other people, and having fun.
    - Ideal: I deliberately invest time in experimenting and reflecting on how I live, and I share notes about what I learn along the way.
    - Strengths I can build on: I'm good at thinking of experiments, particularly small steps I can take to try an idea out. I'm good at sharing what I'm learning through my blog. I'm good at setting aside money and time to make things happen.
    - How I can grow
      - Map out the ideas I'm working on and what I've learned so far.
      - Connect with other lifehackers.
      - Write and share more.
      - Build systems that make it easier for other people to experiment.
  - Preparing and enjoying good food
    - Why this matters: I'm going to eat every day for the rest of my life, so I might as well figure out how to enjoy healthy, yummy food. =) Bonus points if I can share those experiences with other people!
    - Ideal: I have a well-stocked kitchen, plenty of favourite recipes and experiments, awesome cooking and baking skills, and tons of stories.
    - Strengths I can build on: W- and I both enjoy cooking, and he's a great cook. I enjoy exploring recipes and comparing different kinds of ingredients. We have an eat-in kitchen with lots of counter space (and room for two cooks!). We have the time and energy to enjoy cooking and eating at home. We prepare almost all of our meals at home. We have a large outdoor cooling area during winter, and fresh herbs and vegetables from the garden during the rest of the time. ;) We have access to all sorts of ethnic ingredients because Toronto is multicultural. We can walk or bike to good supermarkets. We have a chest freezer and lots of food containers.
    - How I can grow
      - Keep accurate inventories of freezer contents
      - Develop a better groceries/meal plan system
      - Move towards cooking once every two weeks, or longer
      - Explore more recipes: desserts, breakfasts, make-ahead lunches…
  - Growing good food in my garden
    - Why this matters: It's so much fun to watch plants grow, to harvest your own fruits and vegetables, and to pick fresh herbs whenever you want. And the taste and variety are amazing, too! Growing food means we know what's in it, we can explore different kinds, we enjoy really fresh stuff, and we don't throw away as much produce.
    - Ideal: I have a large, productive garden that gives us what we want and takes little effort to maintain. There's plenty of sun for my fruits and vegetables, and some shade for our greens too. I may even get away with a calamansi tree. =D And someday, I'm going to grow asparagus!
    - Strengths I can build on: We have a decent-sized plot with some sun. W- and I built two raised beds. We have plenty of herbs already growing, and a cat-proof space for indoor plants as well. I can get lots of different kinds of seeds online and at stores. I can buy gardening supplies at stores within biking distance. We have lots of earthworms. We have two compost heaps. There are lots of gardeners in Toronto, and plenty of communities and blogs on the Internet.
    - How I can grow
      - Keep a gardening journal
      - Organize seeds by weeks
      - Set up another greenhouse
      - Experiment with starting more seeds
  - Sewing clothes, accessories and gifts
    - Why this matters: I often find shopping frustrating. Things don't fit well, or styles are too frilly, or stores don't have small, petite clothes in black or warm colours. I can't find organizers with the pockets I want. I'd rather make gifts than buy them. Making my clothes, accessories, and gifts is a great way to exercise my imagination and make something real.
    - Ideal: The clothes I make are comfortable, and they fit well. I keep myself organized by making pouches and bags for things. I give people home-made gifts.
    - Strengths I can build on: I enjoy experimenting, and practice has helped me develop my spatial skills too. I'm patient. I enjoy sewing and spending time at home. I've made space for a sewing machine and fabric. I'm close to a fabric store at work. I can bike to places that sell sewing supplies if needed.
    - How I can grow
      - Sew more!
      - Sew more!
      - Sew more!
  - Taking pictures that share memories
    - Why this matters: I like the way that photographs can trigger memories and stories. I want to take more of them. I also want to take better pictures that tell stories or share what I see.
    - Ideal: I always have a camera with me so that I can capture interesting moments. I notice intriguing visual patterns or metaphors. I organize, share, and archive my pictures.
    - Strengths I can build on: My family is into photography, and I can learn from them. W- enjoys photography, too. I have a small camera and a bigger camera with more power. We have a decent collection of lenses. I have a photo gallery on my site, and I can also organize and share pictures on other sites.
    - How I can grow
      - Practice taking a picture every day.
      - Practice really looking around and noticing contrast, colour, etc.
